          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity

   The liquidity  requirements of  the Company  are met primarily by cash flows
from operations of the life insurance subsidiaries and accumulated funds at the
subsidiary level.  These internal sources of liquidity are complemented by such
external sources  as available  bank  lines  of  credit  and  revolving  credit
agreements and  the ability  of the  Company to  utilize  capital  markets  for
intermediate and long-term financing.

   Premium and  investment income  as well  as maturities and sales of invested
assets provide  the primary  sources of  cash available  at the  life insurance
subsidiaries, while  cash is  applied by such subsidiaries to payment of policy
benefits and  loans, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions),
and operating  expenses, as  well as  purchases of  new investments.   Net cash
provided from  operating activities of the life insurance subsidiaries amounted
to $171.1  million in  1993 versus $122.0 million in 1992.  Cash dividends paid
by all  consolidated subsidiaries  to the  parent  company  amounted  to  $61.2
million, $47.7 million and $58.2 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.
Additionally, during  1993, securities  with market value of $21.6 million were
transferred from  a  life  insurance  subsidiary  to  the  parent  company  and
subsequently contributed  to another  life insurance  subsidiary in  connection
with the  combination of  the two subsidiaries' operations.  In addition to the
1992 cash  dividends, securities  with  market  value  of  $26.3  million  were
transferred from  a life  insurance subsidiary  to the parent company following
the  combination   of  operations  of  two  of  the  Company's  life  insurance
subsidiaries.   All of  the aforementioned cash dividends to the parent company
came from  the life  insurance subsidiaries.   The  increase in  cash dividends
received in  1993 reflected capital made available at the subsidiary level from
the combination  of operations  of certain  life insurance  subsidiaries, and a
portion of  the incremental  amount received  was applied  to  repay  corporate
borrowings.   The 1992  decrease in  such dividends  reflected  reduced  parent
company cash  requirements attributed  to various factors including a reduction
in treasury stock purchases.  It should be noted that payment of dividends from
the life  insurance subsidiaries  for application toward liquidity needs at the
parent company  level (including  overhead costs,  interest on indebtedness and
dividends on  preferred and  common stocks)  may require regulatory approval in
cases where  such dividends exceed certain guidelines generally based on income
before capital  gains and  losses and  Equity Capital as reported to regulatory
authorities  on  the  basis  of  statutory  accounting  practices  ("Regulatory
Operating Income" and "Regulatory Equity Capital") and, at a further threshold,
may require  payment of additional taxes under provisions of federal income tax
law applicable  to life  insurance companies.   The life insurance subsidiaries
reported Regulatory  Operating Income of $88.9 million, $56.6 million and $56.6
million in  1993, 1992  and 1991, respectively and Regulatory Equity Capital of
$549.4 million, $525.3 million and $556.8 million as of December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991,  respectively.  In determining the timing and amount of such dividend
payments, management  considers, among other factors, insurance industry rating
agency criteria which are based primarily upon the statutory financial position
of life  insurance companies.   Historically,  these self imposed criteria have
been more restrictive in terms of dividend availability than the aforementioned
regulatory or  tax considerations.   Investment  advisory fees paid by the life
insurance subsidiaries,  which amounted  to $6.4  million in  1993, comprise an
additional source of liquidity at the parent company.

   In addition  to the  liquidity factors  at the  subsidiary level  previously
discussed,  cash   requirements  at   the  parent   company  for   interest  on
indebtedness, dividends  on preferred and common stocks, and overhead costs are
a key factor in the Company's overall liquidity situation.  For the years ended
December 31,  1993, 1992  and 1991,  the aforementioned  items  totalled  $93.4
million, $93.9  million, and  $98.4 million,  respectively.   The decreases  in
these cash  requirements in  1993 and  1992 came  primarily from lower interest
costs attributable  to more  favorable interest  rates applicable to short-term
corporate borrowings  and refinancing  transactions as  discussed below.    The
Company's   common stock  repurchase program  was also  a factor  in  its  cash
requirements during  1992 and  1991 (see discussion under "Capital Resources").
This program,  under which  there were  no market repurchases of treasury stock
during 1993,  was extended by Board action through November 1994 with authority
to repurchase up to one million common shares.
<PAGE>4

   On a  consolidated basis, net cash provided by operating activities amounted
to $141.8  million, $83.5  million and  $77.8 million  in 1993,  1992 and  1991
respectively.   The 1993  increase in   cash  provided by  operating activities
reflected various factors including an increase in capital gains from disposals
of fixed  maturity investments,  primarily a  result of  redemptions  prior  to
maturity by  the respective  issuers, and  a reduced  level of net additions to
deferred policy acquisition costs.  The latter reflects a decline in individual
annuity sales  prompted by  management action to slow the rate of such sales in
late 1992 with objectives including diversification of sales mix and production
sources.

Cash flows  from operating  activities for 1993 included $53.0 million from the
change in  liability for  future policy benefits, versus $26.9 million in 1992,
with increased  written premiums  on credit  insurance coverages a contributing
factor.  Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased to $183.7
million in  1993 versus  $173.5 million  in 1992,  reflecting the  increase  in
policyholder account  balances relating  to individual  annuities and universal
life insurance  contracts with  the impact  of reductions  in credited rates of
interest on  certain contracts  a partial  offsetting factor as discussed under
"Results of Operations."  The portion of policyholder account balances relating
to individual  annuities was  approximately $1.7  billion at  December 31, 1993
versus $1.4  billion at  December 31,  1992, with  the  remainder  relating  to
universal life  insurance contracts.   Interest  rates paid  on these universal
life and  individual annuity  contracts may  be adjusted  periodically  by  the
Company.   Subject to any applicable surrender charges, the Company's universal
life insurance  products and  individual annuities  may be  surrendered by  the
holder.   A cash surrender value, based on contractual terms, is also available
to the  policyholder upon  surrender  of  many  of  the  Company's  traditional
individual life  insurance policies  under which  cash values  are accumulated.
Such  surrenders   are  influenced   by  various   factors  including  economic
conditions,  available   alternative  investment   returns,   competition   for
investment and  insurance  funds,  and  perceived  financial  strength  of  the
insurer.   These contracts  are generally supported by the Company's investment
portfolios, which  are primarily comprised of investment grade, publicly traded
corporate bonds.   Substantially  all of  the Company's interest sensitive life
insurance and annuity contracts provide for imposition of a surrender charge in
the event of policy surrender during a specified initial period commencing with
contract inception, typically ten to fifteen years for universal life insurance
and five to seven years for individual annuities, with the significance of this
charge often  subject to  reduction over  the applicable  period or  during the
later portion  thereof.   The Company's  investment portfolios  are continually
monitored to  determine whether  the distribution  of investment  maturities is
considered appropriate for expected levels of policy surrenders.  The Company's
fixed maturity  investments may  be sold  prior to  maturity  as  part  of  the
Company's  asset   /  liability  management  strategy  and  are  classified  as
"available for  sale" as  discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Adjustments to  the investment maturity distribution, if necessary, may also be
accomplished by  actions concerning  the investment  of incoming  funds  and/or
reinvestment of  the proceeds  of securities  matured or redeemed.  The Company
monitors its surrenders on a monthly basis.  Any material deviation or emerging
trend is  traced to  the product line and agency of record, and remedial action
is taken  where appropriate.    If  an  acceleration  of  surrenders  of  these
contracts were  experienced, the  cash flow  requirements associated  with such
surrenders could  conceivably require the Company to liquidate a portion of the
underlying security  investments prior  to maturity,  at then-prevailing market
prices.  Any additional cash flow requirements would be met through the sources
of liquidity  described earlier.   Net additions to deferred policy acquisition
costs amounted  to $36.1  million in  1993 versus  $57.0 million  in 1992.  The
decline of  approximately $21  million reflected  a lower  level of  individual
annuity sales  during 1993 which, as discussed further below, is also reflected
in the  increase in policyholder account balances included in net cash provided
by "financing" activities.

   Current year  Federal income  tax payments  amounted to $60.7 million, $57.3
million and  $71.4 million  in 1993,  1992 and 1991, respectively.  The Company
and certain  subsidiaries also made payments to, and received refunds from, the
Internal Revenue  Service during  1992 relating to settlement of prior year tax
returns.   The total of such payments, less refunds received, amounted to $18.4
million.  Since the latter payments and refunds were associated with previously
recorded liabilities,  these settlements  had no  impact on reported results of
operations for 1992.  The reduced level of Federal income tax payments relating
to current  operations in  1992 as  compared to  1991 reflects  various factors
including the  utilization  of  an  accumulated  credit  balance  arising  from
previous tax payments.

   Net cash  used in  investing activities  amounted to  $536.3 million, $726.6
million, and  $710.3 million  in 1993,  1992 and  1991, respectively.  The 1993
decrease resulted  primarily from the above-noted decline in individual annuity
sales which,  as discussed  below, also resulted in a reduced level of increase
in policyholder  account balances.   The  1992 increase  related  primarily  to
increased volume  of individual  life insurance  and annuity  contracts.    The
$1.154 billion  and $798.7  million disposals  of  fixed  maturity  investments
included in  cash flows  from investing  activities for 1993 and 1992 included,
respectively, approximately  $928  million  and  $497  million  book  value  of
securities which  were called for redemption by the respective issuers prior to
maturity.   Substantially all  of the  proceeds from  fixed maturities  sold or
redeemed  were   directed  to  investment  grade  fixed  maturity  investments.
Purchases of  fixed maturity  investments in  1993, 1992  and 1991  amounted to
$1.751 billion,  $1.550 billion  and $1.444  billion, respectively,  reflecting
both reinvestment  of the proceeds from fixed maturity disposals and investment
of funds corresponding to the increases in policyholder account balances.  Pre-
tax net  capital gains relating to fixed maturity investments (after impairment
provisions) amounted to $46.9 million, $23.1 million and $11.0 million in 1993,
1992, and  1991, respectively.   The  Company's investment  management policies
include continual  evaluation of securities market conditions and circumstances
relating to  particular investment  holdings which  may result  in selection of
fixed maturity or other investments for sale prior to maturity.  Securities may
also be  sold as  part of  the Company's asset/liability management strategy as
indicated above  in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment
risk, and  similar factors.   The impact of calls of higher yielding securities
out of  the investment  portfolio and  the reinvestment  of proceeds from these
securities, as  well as  funds provided  from operations,  at  lower  available
current rates  is discussed  under "Results of Operations."  Valuation reserves
are maintained for investments with a reduction in value determined to be other
than temporary.   As also indicated in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements,
net unrealized  gains on  the Company's  fixed maturities  portfolio, with book
value of  $4.8 billion  as of  December 31,  1993, amount to approximately $380
million at  that date.   This  amount reflects  gross unrealized  gains of $392
million and  gross  unrealized  losses  of  $12  million.    Based  on  current
evaluation of the paying status of the Company's fixed maturity investments and
anticipated continuation  of the  aforementioned investment policies, the sales
of fixed  maturity investments and retention of certain securities with current
market value  less than  book value are not anticipated to result in a material
adverse impact  upon investment  yield of  the life insurance subsidiaries.  As
discussed in  Note 1  of Notes  to Financial  Statements, the  Company's $361.1
million consolidated  investment in  mortgage loans  as of December 31, 1993 is
characterized by  a broad  geographical  distribution.    The  Company  invests
principally in  commercial mortgages  which comprise  substantially all  of the
total investment  in mortgages  at December  31,  1993.    Commercial  mortgage
investments are  generally made with a loan-to-value ratio not in excess of 75%
and emphasize fully occupied general purpose retail, office and industrial real
estate having broad user appeal on a diversified national basis.  Investment in
real estate  is limited  typically to  selected commercial real estate which is
substantially pre-leased  or  where  the  prospects  of  finding  a  user  upon
completion are  unusually attractive.   As  of  December  31,  1993  and  1992,
consolidated invested  assets included  $25.0 million  and $29.2  million  book
value of  real estate acquired through foreclosure, respectively.  Consolidated
net investment  income for  the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 included
net charges  of approximately  $1.2 million  and $600 thousand relating to such
properties, respectively.   It is the Company's general policy to determine the
estimated net  realizable value of foreclosed real estate based upon appraisals
relating to the underlying mortgage loans which are continually reviewed and/or
updated by  management based  upon market  conditions furnished  by third party
property managers  or brokers.   The  Company maintains  reserves so that these
assets are  carried at  the lower  of cost  or estimated  net realizable value.
Based on  current evaluation  of real  estate properties  held as  a result  of
foreclosure and  anticipated continuation of the Company's policies relating to
disposal of  such properties,  the retention of these properties until disposal
at terms  believed to  reflect their  estimated net  realizable values  is  not
anticipated to  result in  a material  adverse  impact  upon  consolidated  net
investment income or the liquidity of the Company.
<PAGE>6

   Net cash  flows provided  by consolidated  financing activities  amounted to
$380.3 million,  $641.2 million,  and $632.5  million in  1993, 1992  and 1991,
respectively.   The reduced  level of  cash flows  from financing activities in
1993 reflects  the impact  of reduced individual annuity sales, as noted above,
on changes  in policyholder  account balances.   The  increase in  policyholder
account balances amounted to $416.7 million, $647.5 million, and $647.1 million
in 1993,  1992 and  1991, with  gross premiums  on single  premium annuities of
$344.7 million, $524.8 million and $512.1 million in those years, respectively.
Sales of  interest  sensitive  permanent  life  insurance  policies,  with  new
annualized premiums  of $55.8 million, $55.0 million and $53.9 million in 1993,
1992, and  1991, respectively,  and  the  increase  in  accumulated  values  on
contracts in  force were  also factors  in the  growth in  policyholder account
balances.   Premium receipts  for substantially  all of  the Company's interest
sensitive individual  life and  annuity contracts  are not included in reported
revenues but  are instead  directly credited  to the liability for policyholder
account balances as required by FASB Statement No. 97.

   Cash  flows   from  financing   activities  for   1993  include  refinancing
transactions in  which the  Company issued  a total  of $300  million principal
amount of  debt securities under shelf registration statements and utilized the
proceeds to  repay $200  million long  term debt  and $100  million short  term
variable rate  bank debt  as discussed  under "Capital  Resources."  Cash flows
from financing  activities for  1992 included  receipt of $150 million proceeds
from bank  borrowing under  a credit  agreement consummated  in May  1992, also
utilized in  a refinancing  transaction.   The $112.4 million decrease in notes
payable included  in 1993  cash flows  from financing  activities reflects  the
noted refinancing  of short  term variable  rate  bank  debt  as  well  as  the
application of  a  portion  of  dividends  received  from  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries by  the parent  company to  repay short  term bank  borrowings  as
discussed earlier.   The 1992 and 1991 increases in notes payable, amounting to
$23.9  million  and  $25.4  million,  respectively,  resulted  from  short-term
borrowings for  general corporate purposes including incremental repurchases of
the Company's common stock under the treasury stock repurchase program.

   As of  December 31,  1993, the  Company had lines of credit with seven banks
amounting to  $60 million, all of which was unused.  However, at that date, the
Company had  outstanding short-term  borrowings with  three  banks,  negotiated
independently of  such lines  to take  advantage of  more  favorable  available
interest rates,  in the  aggregate amount of $65.5 million.  Also at that date,
the Company  had a  bank revolving  credit agreement  which provides short term
borrowing facilities  up to  $100  million,  under  which  no  borrowings  were
outstanding.   The Company's  short term borrowings were utilized primarily for
working capital requirements.


Capital Resources

   Long term  debt at  December 31,  1993 includes  a $150 million non-callable
issue of  6.75% Notes  due 1998 and a $150 million non-callable issue of 6.375%
Notes due  2000, both issued in early 1993 under shelf registration statements.
The Company  has filed  an additional shelf registration statement which, as of
December 31,  1993, permits the issuance of up to $150 million principal amount
of debt  securities subject  to management's discretion as to timing and amount
of issues  thereunder.   The proceeds  of the  1993  issues  were  utilized  in
connection with  the redemption  of the  Company's $50  million issue of 8.875%
Notes due  1995 and  its $100  million issue  of 8.375%  Notes due 1996, and to
repay $50  million bank debt under a credit facility (which had been classified
as long  term debt)  and an additional $100 million of short term variable rate
bank debt.   The  Company's remaining  long term  debt  at  December  31,  1993
consists of a $50 million issue of 9.15% Notes due 1999 which permits repayment
at the  option of the Company prior to maturity, commencing in 1996.   While it
is currently  anticipated that  the major portion of the long term debt will be
repaid using  the net  proceeds of debt and/or equity or combination securities
to be  issued at  future dates,  determination of the timing and amount of such
repayments  and   securities  issues  will  be  dependent  upon  future  market
conditions, future cash flows, and other unforeseen circumstances.
<PAGE>7

     For the  years ended  December 31,  1993,  1992  and  1991,  respectively,
consolidated interest  expense amounted  to $32.4  million, $33.8  million, and
$39.2 million,  with $26.7  million, $25.9  million, and  $28.7 million of such
interest expense  relating to  long term debt.  Dividends paid on the Company's
outstanding stock  issues for such years were $27.4 million, $25.8 million, and
$24.8 million,  substantially all  relating to  common stock.  The increases in
such dividends  reflected increases  in common  stock dividends  per share from
$1.07 in  1991 to  $1.14  in  1992  and  $1.21  in  1993.    The  decreases  in
consolidated interest  expense in  1993 and  1992 resulted  primarily from more
favorable interest  rates applicable  to short-term  borrowings and refinancing
transactions as  indicated above.   The impact of more favorable interest rates
in 1992  as compared  to 1991  more than  offset the  additional interest  cost
associated with financing of incremental treasury stock repurchases.

     The  life   insurance  subsidiaries   enter  into   standby   commitments,
representing contingent  obligations to replace certain borrowings in the event
of  default  by  unaffiliated  borrowers,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  their
investment operations  and, as  of December  31,  1993,  a  subsidiary  had  an
outstanding standby  commitment  of  $6.8  million.    Historically,  the  life
insurance subsidiaries  have not  provided permanent  financing  on  the  major
portion of such standby commitments.

     The Company  has outstanding  Standby Letters  of Credit  with  two  banks
representing contingent  obligations to  fund  various  trusts  established  in
connection with  certain employment  contracts  of  management  employees,  the
Company's Supplemental  Retirement Plan, Retirement Plan for Outside Directors,
and Retirement  Plan, in  the event  of a  Change in Control (as defined in the
trust agreements), totalling $31 million.  Additionally, in connection with the
application by  a life  insurance subsidiary for an additional state license to
transact business, USLIFE Corporation has agreed to guarantee that subsidiary's
maintenance of  the state's minimum capital and surplus requirements (amounting
to $4.4  million as  of December  31, 1993) for a ten year period commencing at
the effective date of such license.


Results of Operations


     1993 Compared to 1992

     For the year ended December 31, 1993, net income amounted to $97.2 million
versus $69.6  million (before  a $38.0 million charge for "cumulative effect of
accounting change" as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements) for
1992.   The $97.2  million net  income  for  1993  included  net  capital  gain
transactions with  an after-tax  impact of  $5.5 million,  while  1992  results
included an  after-tax charge  of $1.7  million from similar transactions.  The
net capital  gains reported  for 1993  reflected $54.5 million pre-tax gains on
disposals of fixed maturity investments, which were partially offset by pre-tax
losses of  approximately $10.7  million on  disposal of  certain  real  estate,
mortgage and  joint venture  investments and by additions to valuation reserves
for certain  investments with  loss exposure.   The net capital losses reported
for 1992  reflected  the  disposal  of  certain  real  estate  investments  and
additions to  valuation reserves  for certain  investments with  loss  exposure
which, together,  more than offset pre-tax capital gains of approximately $23.2
million from  disposals of  fixed maturity  investments.   As  discussed  under
"Financial Condition,"  the  major  portion  of  disposals  of  fixed  maturity
investments during  1993 and  1992 related  to securities which were called for
redemption by  the respective  issuers prior  to maturity.    Consolidated  net
income for  1993 also  includes a gain of $1.5 million (after applicable taxes)
from sale  of a  subsidiary's home office property and a charge of $2.0 million
to recognize  the cumulative  impact of  the change in corporate Federal income
tax rates  enacted in  August 1993  as required  by FASB Statement No. 109.  In
addition to  this charge,  it is  estimated that the increased rates negatively
impacted second  half 1993  net income  by approximately  $850 thousand.    Net
income for  1992 reflects  a charge equivalent to $10.6 million on an after-tax
basis to  establish a  reserve for amounts receivable from an Association Group
Health marketing organization which declared bankruptcy.
<PAGE>8

     Excluding the transactions discussed above (capital gains and losses, 1993
recognition of  cumulative impact  of income  tax rate  change and  home office
property sale,  and 1992  charges for  "cumulative effect of accounting change"
and receivables),  consolidated after-tax  income amounted to $92.1 million for
1993 versus  $81.9 million for 1992, an increase of $10.2 million or 12.5%.  On
a similar basis, after-tax income of the life insurance subsidiaries other than
the aforementioned  items increased  $8.1 million  or 6.9%.  The improvement in
life insurance  subsidiary results  came primarily  from an increase in pre-tax
profits from  the individual  life and  annuity product line and a reduction in
pre-tax losses  from "other  group health" coverages, as discussed below.  Also
on a  similar basis,  after-tax  corporate  charges  (including  the  operating
results of  USLIFE's servicing  units) amounted to $34.5 million in 1993 versus
$36.6  million  for  1992,  resulting  in  a  positive  comparative  impact  of
approximately $2  million on  after-tax consolidated results.  Results for 1993
benefited from  lower interest  costs attributable to refinancings of long term
debt and  more favorable  interest rates  applicable to  short  term  corporate
borrowings, as  well as  capital made  available at  the corporate  level as  a
result of the combination of operations of certain life insurance subsidiaries.
In June  1993 the  Company utilized  the proceeds  of its $150 million issue of
6.375% Notes due 2000 to repay short term variable rate bank debt which, at the
time of  repayment, had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
The impact  of the  latter  refinancing  partially  offset  the  reductions  in
interest expense  from long  term debt  refinancing  transactions.    Corporate
charges  reflect,   among  other  factors,  interest  expense  associated  with
financing of repurchases of the Company's common stock under the treasury stock
repurchase program.

     Pre-tax income  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries for  1993,  excluding
capital gains  and losses  and the  subsidiary home  office sale  as previously
discussed, was  $192.9 million.  For 1992, pre-tax income of the life insurance
subsidiaries excluding  capital gains and losses and the charge for "cumulative
effect of  accounting change"  was $161.4 million, reflecting the $16.0 million
pre-tax impact  of the aforementioned receivables charge.  The major portion of
the life insurance subsidiaries' pre-tax income is attributed to the individual
life insurance  and annuity product line.  A pre-tax profit of $9.3 million was
attributed to  all health insurance coverages in 1993, versus a pre-tax loss of
$19.3 million  in 1992  which resulted  primarily from  the receivables charge.
Employer-employee group health insurance coverages, which are generally written
as a  corollary  to  employer-employee  group  life  insurance,  accounted  for
approximately 86%  and 87% of total health insurance premiums in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.    Employer-employee  group  insurance  coverages  are  discussed
further below.   The  remainder of  the  Company's  health  insurance  business
consists  of  credit  disability  insurance,  "other  group  health"  insurance
(primarily association  group health),  and individual  health  and  disability
coverages.   As indicated  above, the  increase in  life  insurance  subsidiary
after-tax income for 1993 versus 1992 is primarily attributed to an increase in
pre-tax profits  from the  individual life  and  annuity  product  line  and  a
reduction in  pre-tax losses from "other group health" coverages.  A discussion
of the  Company's various  product lines, excluding the impact of capital gains
and losses  and the  1993  subsidiary  home  office  property  sale  which  are
previously discussed, follows.

     Individual life and annuity pre-tax profits, including income attributable
to capital  and surplus,  amounted to  $177.1 million  for 1993  versus  $169.3
million for  1992.   The increase  of $7.8  million or 4.6% reflected favorable
mortality experience during the first nine months of 1993 and a continuation of
gains from investment income margins.

     A pre-tax  profit of  $1.3 million  was reported for credit life insurance
coverages for  1993,  versus  $3.2  million  in  1992,  reflecting  unfavorable
mortality experience during the second and third quarters of 1993.  Credit life
insurance business  in three  key states, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania,
contributed to  this unfavorable  mortality experience.    Since  these  states
require rate  modifications based  on experience over a three-year interval, it
is anticipated that the rating formulas should permit rate adjustments over the
next several years that take into account the current year experience.
<PAGE>9

     Pre-tax profits  from the Company's group life insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.2 million  for 1993 versus $8.2 million for 1992, a decrease of
$3.0 million.  The negative variance was attributed primarily to less favorable
results from  association group  life insurance coverages and certain specialty
coverages, such  as mortgage life insurance, included in the "other group life"
line.    Pre-tax  profits from  employer-employee group life insurance products
were $4.1  million for  1993 versus  $4.6  million  in  1992,  reflecting  less
favorable mortality experience in 1993.

     The individual  health and disability product line reported a pre-tax loss
of $290  thousand for  1993, versus  a pre-tax  loss of $461 thousand for 1992.
This  product  line  consists  primarily  of  certain  specialty  products  and
coverages issued upon conversion of certain group health insurance products.

     Pre-tax profits  from the  credit disability product line amounted to $5.0
million for  1993, versus  $1.9 million  in  1992,  reflecting  more  favorable
morbidity experience during 1993.

     Total pre-tax  income from  group health  insurance coverages  amounted to
$4.6 million  for 1993,  consisting of  a pre-tax  profit of  $8.9 million from
employer-employee group  health insurance  products and  a pre-tax loss of $4.3
million from  "other group health" products, primarily association group health
insurance.  For 1992, a pre-tax loss of approximately $4.8 million was reported
for group  health insurance  coverages (in addition to the aforementioned $16.0
million receivables  charge), consisting  of a  pre-tax profit  of $7.3 million
from employer-employee  group health  insurance products  and a pre-tax loss of
$12.0 million  from "other  group health"  products.   The increase  in pre-tax
income from  employer-employee group  health insurance coverages reflected more
favorable morbidity  experience in  1993 which  more than  offset the impact of
terminations on  a certain  block of business affected by recent legislation as
discussed below.   Premium income from employer-employee group health insurance
coverages amounted  to approximately  $425 million for 1993 versus $437 million
for 1992.   Premiums  charged for  these products  are subject to periodic rate
adjustments by  the Company which considers, among other factors, trends in the
costs of  benefits provided  in setting  such rates.   Profitability  of  these
products is dependent upon various factors including the ability of the Company
to match  premiums charged  to increases in benefit costs through periodic rate
adjustments and  to maintain  underwriting standards so that premium charged is
consistent with  risk assumed  on an  overall basis.  New York State "community
rating - open enrollment" legislation applicable to insured group medical plans
with less  than fifty  employees, which  became effective  as of April 1, 1993,
prohibits the use of individual underwriting techniques for group major medical
business, which  is included  in the  Company's employer-employee  group health
product line.   The  legislation permits carriers to use pre-existing condition
exclusions to  protect against  adverse selection, but prohibits the use of age
and sex  factors in  rating, and  requires that  average rates  be used for the
aforementioned plans.     All affected  in-force business  had to be renewed in
accordance with  the new requirements as of April 1, 1993, and consequently the
Company suspended new business sales of these products in New York State during
the first  quarter to  prepare for  the renewal  process and resumed such sales
effective on the latter date.  This process resulted in an unusually high level
of policy  lapses and  negative impact  on premium  income during  1993 for the
affected coverages in New York State.  Since group life insurance is often sold
in conjunction  with these  medical  sales,  there  was  a  similar  impact  on
employer-employee group  life insurance  products.   In response to current and
anticipated health  insurance reform,  the Company  announced in  December 1993
that it  would restrict  its sales  of new major medical business to 21 states,
including New  York, in which it has a significant amount of in-force business,
while continuing renewals of this business in all states.  Based on preliminary
analysis, the  Company does  not currently anticipate a material adverse impact
on its  consolidated operations  to result from the New York legislation or the
actions taken  with respect to this line of business.  The decrease in the pre-
tax loss for "other group health" products (primarily association group health)
from $12.0  million in  1992 to  $4.3 million  in 1993  reflected a  decline in
expenses attributed  to this  line as  well as  improved morbidity  experience.
Legal and  other expenses relating to the aforementioned marketing organization
bankruptcy was  the  major  contributing  factor  in  the  1993  pre-tax  loss,
primarily incurred during the first half of the year,  and a significant factor
in the  1992 loss.   The  1992 loss  for this product line also reflected legal
expenses relating  to a  reinsurance dispute  concerning certain  group medical
insurance programs  previously written by a subsidiary of the Company, in which
settlements were subsequently reached with the reinsurers involved.
<PAGE>10

     Total revenues  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries in  1993 amounted  to
$1.583 billion,  an increase  of $69.0  million or 4.6% over 1992, primarily on
increases of  $25.0 million  (or 2.3%)  and $29.3 million (or 7.3%) in premiums
and considerations  and net  investment income,  respectively.    Other  income
increased $1.7 million to $18.3 million in 1993, reflecting $2.3 million income
from the  sale of  a subsidiary's home office property during the third quarter
of 1993.   The  increase in premiums and considerations came primarily from the
individual life  insurance and  annuity product line and from increased written
premiums on  the Company's  credit insurance  products.   A decrease  of  $12.8
million in employer-employee group insurance premiums, reflecting the impact of
recent state  legislation as  discussed above,  was a partial offset.  Premiums
and other  considerations from  individual life  insurance and annuity products
amounted to  $388.1 million  in 1993,  compared to $366.7 million in 1992, with
the  increase  from  both  interest  sensitive  and  traditional  products  and
reflecting a  larger base  of in-force  business.   Although the pre-tax annual
yield on  investments declined  from 8.76%  in  1992  to  8.35%  in  1993,  net
investment income  increased  $29.3  million  as  noted  above  with  a  larger
investment base  in 1993.   This  decrease in  pre-tax annual  yield reflects a
continuing decline  in market  interest rates  which has  resulted in  calls of
higher yielding securities out of the investment portfolio and the reinvestment
of proceeds  from these  securities, as well as funds provided from operations,
at lower  available current rates.  In this connection, it should be noted that
the Company's  liability for  policyholder account  balances, amounting to $3.3
billion at  December 31, 1993, relates to interest sensitive life insurance and
annuity contracts  that are subject to periodic adjustment of credited interest
rates.   Credited interest  rates are determined by management based on factors
including available  market interest  rates  and  portfolio  rates  of  return.
Interest rates  credited on the Company's deferred annuity contracts, exclusive
of first  year increments  on certain  products, typically  ranged from 6.8% to
5.0% during 1992 and from 5.0% to 4.5% in 1993.  Interest rates credited on the
Company's universal life insurance contracts typically ranged from 8.5% to 6.5%
in 1992  and from  7.5% to 6.0% in 1993, reflecting periodic decreases in these
credited rates  during both  1993 and  1992.   In the  event of  future general
increases in  market interest  rates,  the  market  value  of  certain  of  the
Company's investments  including its fixed maturity portfolio would be expected
to decrease, and the contribution to the Company's earnings from the difference
between interest  earned on investments and interest credited on these products
could be  adversely affected, depending on the timing and extent of adjustments
in credited  rates of  interest on  in-force business  and  in  the  investment
portfolio in response to such changes.

     Total benefits  and expenses  of the life insurance subsidiaries increased
$22.3 million  or 1.6% over 1992, reflecting the inclusion of the $16.0 million
receivables  charge   in  1992   results.     Benefits  to   policyholders  and
beneficiaries amounted  to $737.7  million in  1993, versus  $740.6 million  in
1992.   The decrease  reflects various  factors including reduced volume in the
employer-employee group health line relating to policy lapses attributed to the
impact of  recent state  legislation as  previously discussed and the impact of
favorable mortality  and voluntary  policy termination experience on individual
life coverages.   Interest  credited to policyholder account balances increased
$10.2 million (or 5.9%), reflecting the increased volume of universal life-type
and individual  annuity contracts  in 1993  with the  impact of  reductions  in
credited rates  of interest  on certain  contracts a partial offsetting factor.
An increase  in future  policy benefits of $39.8 million was recorded for 1993,
versus $34.8  million for  1992,  with  the  $5.0  million  variance  primarily
associated with  the increase in written premiums on credit insurance coverages
as noted  above.  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amounted to
$151.9 million  in 1993  versus $131.8  million  in  1992,  reflecting  various
factors including  the increased volume of individual life and annuity business
in force  during 1993.  Excluding the impact of the 1992 receivables charge, an
aggregate increase  of $6.2 million or 2.5% in commissions, insurance taxes and
licenses, and  general expenses  reflected the  increased individual  life  and
annuity volume,  with reduced  legal and  other expenses relating to the "other
group health" product line a partial offset.

     At December  31, 1993, consolidated invested assets included approximately
$221 million  book value  of less  than investment  grade corporate securities,
based  on   ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and  insurance
regulatory authorities.   Such  investments had  an aggregate  market value  of
approximately $232  million at  December 31,  1993 and,  based on  book  value,
represent approximately 3% of consolidated total assets at that date.  See Note
1 of  Notes to  Financial Statements for further information.  These securities
generally provide  higher yields and involve greater risk of loss from borrower
default than  investment grade  securities because their issuers typically have
higher levels  of indebtedness  and are  more vulnerable  to  adverse  economic
conditions  than   other  issuers.     The   Company's  results  of  operations
historically have  not reflected  a material adverse impact from investments in
such securities.

     In November,  1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement  No.   112,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postemployment  Benefits."
Statement No.  112 must  be implemented in 1994.  In May, 1993, FASB issued two
additional Statements  which will  require the  Company to adopt new accounting
and reporting  standards in  preparation of future period financial statements.
Statement No. 114,  "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," must be
adopted by  calendar year  enterprises no  later than 1995.  Statement No. 115,
"Accounting for  Certain Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity  Securities,"  will
require  most  fixed  maturity  investments  to  be  carried  at  market  value
commencing in 1994.  These FASB Statements are discussed in  Note 1 of Notes to
Financial Statements.


     1992 Compared to 1991

   Net income in 1992 amounted to $31.6 million, and was net of a $38.0 million
after-tax charge  for "cumulative  effect of accounting change" relating to the
adoption of  new accounting  standards for  non-pension postretirement benefits
required by  Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, as discussed
in Note  1 of  Notes to  Financial Statements.   Other  than this  charge,  the
adoption of  this Statement  as well  as the  1992  adoption  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," by means
of restatement  had no  material impact  on reported  results of operations for
1992 or  1991.   Excluding this  charge, after-tax  income for 1992 amounted to
$69.6 million,  a decrease  of $5.1  million or  6.8% as compared to 1991.  Net
income for  1992 reflects  a charge equivalent to $10.6 million on an after-tax
basis to  establish a  reserve for amounts receivable from an Association Group
Health marketing  organization which declared bankruptcy.  Reported results for
1992 include  net  capital  loss  transactions  with  an  after-tax  impact  of
approximately $1.7  million, while  1991 net  income included  net capital loss
transactions with  an after-tax  impact of $1.2 million.  The 1992 and 1991 net
capital losses  reflected the  disposal of  certain real  estate properties and
additions to  valuation reserves  for certain  investments with  loss  exposure
which, in  the aggregate,  more than  offset   gross pre-tax capital gains from
sales of  fixed maturity  investments amounting  to  $23.2  million  and  $19.4
million, respectively.       Excluding  capital  gains  and  losses,  the  1992
receivables  charge,   and  the   cumulative  effect   of  accounting   change,
consolidated after-tax  income for  1992 was $81.9 million, an increase of $6.1
million or  8.0% from  the comparable  $75.8 million  for 1991.   On  a similar
basis, after-tax  results of  the life  insurance subsidiaries  other than  the
aforementioned items  amounted to  $118.5 million  in 1992, an increase of $1.7
million or  1.5% versus  the comparable  $116.8  million  in  1991,  reflecting
improved results  from the  individual life  and annuity  product  line.    The
improved results  for this  product line  were partially  offset by unfavorable
results from  "other  group  health"  coverages  (primarily  association  group
health), which  as discussed  below recorded a pre-tax loss of $12.0 million in
1992 before  the $16.0 million pre-tax impact of the receivables charge, versus
a $916  thousand pre-tax  loss in 1991.  Comparative results from the Company's
other group and credit insurance lines and the individual health and disability
product line  also offset  the improved  individual life  and annuity  results.
After-tax corporate  charges,  including  the  operating  results  of  USLIFE's
servicing units (before capital gains and losses), amounted to $36.6 million in
1992 versus  $41.0 million  in 1991, resulting in a positive comparative impact
of $4.4  million on after-tax consolidated results.  Results for 1992 benefited
from  lower   interest  costs  attributed  to  more  favorable  interest  rates
applicable to  short-term corporate borrowings and the $150 million refinancing
in May  1992 as  discussed under  "Capital Resources",  as well as capital made
available at  the corporate  level  from  the  combination  in  early  1992  of
operations of  two of  the Company's  life insurance  subsidiaries.   Corporate
charges in  1991 reflect  the inclusion  of $903  thousand income of the parent
company (net  of related  taxes) from  sale of  the life insurance charter of a
former subsidiary.   Corporate  charges reflect,  among other factors, interest
expense associated  with financing of repurchases of the Company's common stock
under the  treasury stock  repurchase program.  As a result of the reduction in
outstanding shares,  it is estimated that these transactions had a net positive
impact of approximately 3 cents per share on comparative results.
<PAGE>12

     Pre-tax income of the life insurance subsidiaries, excluding capital gains
and losses  and the  cumulative effect  of accounting  change relating  to FASB
Statement No.  106, amounted  to $161.4  million in  1992, reflecting the $16.0
million impact  of the aforementioned receivables charge, versus $173.7 million
in 1991.  As noted above, life insurance subsidiary pre-tax income benefited in
1992 from improved results on the Company's individual life and annuity product
line, with  these improved  results offset  by  unfavorable  association  group
health results  and by  comparative results  from the Company's other group and
credit  insurance   lines  and  the  individual  health  and  disability  line.
Excluding capital gains and losses, individual life and annuity pre-tax profits
for 1992  amounted to  $169.3 million,  an increase  of $19.7  million or 13.1%
versus 1991.   Improved  investment income  margins, favorable voluntary policy
termination experience, and a positive contribution from mortality results were
the major factors in this increase.  A pre-tax loss of $19.3 million, including
the aforementioned $16.0 million charge, was attributed to all health insurance
coverages in  1992, while  1991 results  reflected a  pre-tax profit  of  $10.3
million from  health  insurance  coverages.    Employer-employee  group  health
insurance  coverages,   which  are   discussed  further  below,  accounted  for
approximately 87%  and 83%  of total health insurance premiums in 1992 and 1991
respectively.   An aggregate  pre-tax loss  of $28.0  million was  recorded for
"other group  health" products  (primarily association  group health)  in  1992
versus a  pre-tax loss of $916 thousand in 1991.  The $16.0 million receivables
charge was  the major  factor in  the 1992  loss, with  the remainder resulting
primarily from  charges to  reflect the  impact of  settlement of a reinsurance
dispute concerning  certain group medical insurance programs previously written
by a  subsidiary of  the Company  as well  as legal  expenses and  other  costs
relating both  to the  reinsurance dispute  and the  marketing organization  in
bankruptcy  (see   Note  9   of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further
information).   Credit insurance  pre-tax earnings  for 1992  amounted to  $5.1
million,   a decrease  of $2.4  million from  1991 results,  reflecting reduced
earned premium  and temporary expense increases associated with the combination
of operations  of two  of the Company's credit insurance subsidiaries.  Pre-tax
income from  employer-employee group  insurance  coverages  amounted  to  $11.9
million in  1992 versus  $13.2  million  in  1991,  reflecting  less  favorable
mortality and  morbidity  experience.    Premium  income  from  these  products
amounted to  approximately $505  million for 1992 versus $425 million for 1991,
including premiums  of $437  million and  $361 million  from  employer-employee
group health  coverages,  respectively.    Pre-tax  income  from  these  health
coverages amounted  to approximately  $7.3 million  (or 1.7% of premiums), $8.2
million (or  2.3% of premiums), and $6.8 million (or 2.3% of premiums) in 1992,
1991 and  1990, respectively, with less favorable morbidity experience in 1992.
Results for  1992 reflected a pre-tax loss of $461 thousand from the individual
health and  disability product  line, compared  to a  pre-tax  profit  of  $399
thousand for  1991, with  the variance primarily from poor morbidity experience
during 1992  on specialty  products included in this line.  Pre-tax income from
"other group  life" products amounted to $2.2 million in 1992, compared to $3.2
million in  1991, reflecting  less  favorable  mortality  experience  on  group
mortgage life insurance coverages included in this product line.
<PAGE>13

     Total revenues  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries in  1992 amounted  to
$1.514 billion,  an increase  of $145.6  million or  10.6%  compared  to  1991,
primarily on  increases of $94.7 million (or 9.4%) and $50.9 million (or 14.5%)
in premiums  and considerations  and net  investment income, respectively.  The
increase in  premiums and  considerations came  primarily  from  the  Company's
employer-employee group  health insurance  product line,  reflecting  increased
volume and  the impact of a series of group health rate increases, and from the
individual life insurance product line.  Premiums and other considerations from
individual life  insurance and  annuity products  amounted to $366.7 million in
1992, compared  to $351.2 million in 1991, with the increase from both interest
sensitive and  traditional products  and reflecting  a larger  base of in-force
business.  Although the pre-tax annual yield on investments declined from 8.95%
in 1991  to 8.76%  in 1992,  net investment  income increased  $50.9 million as
noted above  with a  larger investment  base in 1992.  This decrease in pre-tax
annual yield  reflected a  continuing decline  in market  interest rates  which
resulted in calls of higher yielding securities out of the investment portfolio
and the  reinvestment of  proceeds from  these securities,  as  well  as  funds
provided from  operations, at  lower available  rates.   In this connection, it
should be  noted that the Company's liability for policyholder account balances
relates to  interest sensitive  life insurance  and annuity  contracts that are
subject to  periodic adjustment  of credited  interest rates.   Interest  rates
credited on  the Company's  deferred annuity contracts, exclusive of first year
increments on  certain products, typically ranged from 8.0% to 6.8% during 1991
and from  6.8% to  5.0% in  1992.   Interest rates  credited on  the  Company's
universal life  insurance contracts  typically ranged from 9.0% to 7.7% in 1991
and from  8.5% to 6.5% in 1992, reflecting periodic decreases in these credited
rates during both 1991 and 1992.

   Total benefits  and expenses  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries increased
$157.8 million  or 13.2%  compared  to  1991,  reflecting  the  impact  of  the
aforementioned $16.0 million receivables charge.  The increase of $53.9 million
(or 7.9%)  in benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries reflected an increase
of $61.5  million (or  22.6%) in  benefits on  employer-employee  group  health
insurance products,  relating primarily to the increased volume on that product
line.   A reduced  level of  surrender benefits  on traditional individual life
insurance  products   in  1992,   reflecting  improved   voluntary  termination
experience as  noted above,  was  a  partial  offset.    Interest  credited  to
policyholder account  balances increased  $36.0 million  (or 26.2%), reflecting
the increased volume of universal life-type and individual annuity contracts in
1992.  An increase in liability for future policy benefits of $34.8 million was
recorded in  1992, versus $10.8 million in 1991, reflecting the increased sales
of traditional  individual life  insurance products  in 1992 and an increase in
written premiums  on credit  insurance products.   Excluding  the impact of the
aforementioned $16.0  million  charge  relating  to  association  group  health
receivables, an  aggregate increase  of $27.1  million in  commissions, general
expenses, and  insurance taxes  and licenses  reflected the increased volume on
individual life and employer-employee group products as discussed above.

Life Insurance

  General

     In 1993,  USLIFE's life insurance business was conducted by four operating
life insurance  subsidiaries (the  "Life Insurance  Subsidiaries"): The  United
States Life  Insurance Company  In The City of New York ("United States Life"),
All American  Life Insurance  Company ("All  American Life"), The Old Line Life
Insurance Company  of  America  ("Old  Line  Life"),  and  USLIFE  Credit  Life
Insurance Company ("USLIFE Credit Life").

     The  Life   Insurance  Subsidiaries   are  all  domestic  stock  insurance
corporations with  strong regional  identifications.  United States Life is the
oldest stock life insurance company in America, having been incorporated in New
York in  February, 1850.   While  authorized to do business in all fifty states
and the  District of Columbia, its business is heavily concentrated in New York
and adjacent eastern states.  All American Life was incorporated in Illinois in
1950, and is licensed to do business in all states, except New York, and in the
District of  Columbia.   Approximately 34%  of its business in 1993 was derived
from the central and southwestern regions of the United States.  Old Line Life,
incorporated in  Wisconsin in 1910, is authorized to do business in all states,
except New  York, and in the District of Columbia; its business is concentrated
heavily in  Wisconsin, California,  New Jersey  and the north central region of
the United  States.   USLIFE Credit  Life, whose  predecessors date  from 1890,
derives most  of its  business from  its  home  state  of  Illinois  and  other
midwestern and northwestern states.
<PAGE>15


  Types of Insurance Written

     The Life Insurance Subsidiaries offer a broad portfolio of individual life
insurance and  annuity policies.  Also, through United States Life, part of the
sales forces  of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries offer  group life and health
insurance policies  with particular  emphasis on  small groups.  Group life and
health insurance  policies are  also offered  to associations.   Several of the
Life Insurance  Subsidiaries also  offer products designed for funding pension,
profit-sharing and  other qualified  plans.  In addition, through USLIFE Equity
Sales Corp.,  equity products  are available  for the  noninsurance portion  of
these plans.   Credit  insurance is  offered principally  through USLIFE Credit
Life.

     Individual life  policies  are  offered  by  all  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries,  except   USLIFE  Credit   Life,  on   a  non-participating   and
participating  basis.     Participating  insurance  is  insurance  whereby  the
policyholder is  entitled to receive policy dividends reflecting the difference
between the premium charged and actual experience, the premium being calculated
to provide  a margin  over the  anticipated cost  of insurance  protection.  On
December 31, 1993, approximately 2.5% of individual life insurance in force was
participating and  premiums  on  participating  policies  represented  6.8%  of
individual life insurance premium income in 1993.  See "Participating Policies"
in Note  1 of  Notes to  Financial Statements.   All group business, other than
credit life insurance, is on a non-participating basis but approximately 12% of
such business is subject to experience ratings under which the policyholder may
receive refund  credits depending  on experience.   Substantially  all  of  the
credit life insurance in force is non-participating.


  Development

     The following tabulations set forth the classes of life insurance in force
at December  31, and  the amount  of new  life insurance  paid for  and premium
income in each of the years 1989 through 1993.

</TABLE>

     Universal life  insurance represents  approximately 37%,  37% and  36%  of
total individual  life insurance  in force at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, reflecting  the increased  marketplace emphasis  toward  interest
sensitive products.   Universal life insurance policies permit the policyholder
to vary  the timing  and amount of premium payments, within contractual limits.
Premium payments  under these  policies  are  credited  to  the  policyholder's
account balance,  from which  amounts are  assessed for risk and administrative
charges.   These charges  are subject  to periodic  adjustment by  the Company.
Interest is  credited to  the policyholder's account balance at rates which are
subject to  periodic adjustment by the Company.  The remainder of the Company's
individual life  insurance in  force consists primarily of whole life insurance
and term  insurance coverages.   These  contracts generally  provide for  fixed
premium payments  and death  benefits.   Whole life  policies provide insurance
over the entire life of the insured, with the face amount payable only upon the
death of the insured, and typically provide for the accumulation of a surrender
value based  on contractual  terms which  may be payable to the policyholder or
utilized to purchase a different form of insurance in the event that the policy
is terminated  prior to  death of the insured.  Term insurance policies provide
insurance over  a specified period of time, with the face amount payable if the
insured dies  during the  policy term.   Inasmuch as term policies generally do
not provide for maturity benefits or accumulation of significant cash surrender
values, premiums  per dollar  of death  benefit are  often initially lower than
those of  whole life  policies.   The 1993  and 1992 increases in face value of
individual insurance  issued reflect  increased sales  of  both  universal  and
traditional products  as compared  to the  prior year.    The  face  amount  of
individual life  insurance terminated, in the aggregate, by lapse and surrender
amounted to  $7.9 billion,  $7.7 billion,  and $7.6  billion in  1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.  The relative consistency of these terminations despite the
greater base  of  in-force  business  reflected  a  continuation  of  favorable
voluntary policy  termination  ("persistency")  experience.    Subject  to  any
applicable surrender  charges, the  Company's universal life insurance products
and individual  annuities may  be surrendered  by the holder.  A cash surrender
value, based  on contractual  terms, is also available to the policyholder upon
surrender of  many of  the  Company's  traditional  individual  life  insurance
policies under  which  cash  values  are  accumulated.    Such  surrenders  are
influenced  by   various  factors   including  economic  conditions,  available
alternative investment returns, competition for investment and insurance funds,
and perceived financial strength of the insurer.  These contracts are generally
supported by  the investment  portfolios of  the Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries,
which are  primarily comprised  of investment  grade, publicly traded corporate
bonds.   Substantially all  of the  Company's interest sensitive life insurance
and annuity contracts provide for imposition of a surrender charge in the event
of policy  surrender during a specified initial period commencing with contract
inception, typically ten to fifteen years for universal life insurance and five
to seven  years for  individual annuities, with the significance of this charge
often subject  to reduction  over the  applicable period  or during  the  later
portion thereof.  The Company's investment portfolios are continually monitored
<PAGE>18

to determine  whether the  distribution of  investment maturities is considered
appropriate for  expected levels  of policy surrenders.  The amortized cost and
estimated  market   value  of  the  Company's  debt  security  investments,  by
contractual maturity, are set forth in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.
As discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of  Operations herein,  the Company's fixed maturity investments may be
sold prior  to maturity  as part  of the Company's asset / liability management
strategy and  are classified  as "available  for sale."    Adjustments  to  the
investment maturity  distribution, if  necessary, may  also be  accomplished by
actions concerning  the investment of incoming funds and/or reinvestment of the
proceeds  of  securities  matured  or  redeemed.    The  Company  monitors  its
surrenders on  a monthly  basis.   Any material  deviation or emerging trend is
traced to  the product  line and agency of record, and remedial action is taken
where appropriate.   The  aggregate face  amount of  group and credit insurance
issued in  1991 reflected  significant volume  of new group term life insurance
sales by  United States  Life.   During 1992  and 1993, subsequent increases in
face amount  relating to this business are included in "Increase, net" above in
accordance with  regulatory reporting practice.  The 1993 increase in aggregate
volume of  group and credit insurance issued was primarily attributed to credit
life insurance  and reflected  various factors  including new volume on certain
cases transferred to USLIFE Credit Life from another subsidiary.



  Accident and Health Insurance

</TABLE>

     Group health  business has  been  written  traditionally  as  a  necessary
corollary to the sale of group life insurance.  The 1992 loss from group health
insurance coverages  reflects a  pre-tax charge of $16.0 million to establish a
reserve for  amounts receivable  from an  association  group  health  marketing
organization which  declared bankruptcy.   The remainder of the loss from these
coverages in  1992 resulted  primarily from  charges to  reflect the  impact of
settlement of  a reinsurance dispute concerning certain group medical insurance
programs previously  written by  a subsidiary  of the  Company as well as legal
expenses and  other costs  relating both  to the  reinsurance dispute  and  the
marketing organization  in  bankruptcy  (see  Note  9  of  Notes  to  Financial
Statements for  further information).   New York State "community rating - open
enrollment" legislation  applicable to  insured group  medical plans  with less
than fifty employees, which became effective as of April 1, 1993, prohibits the
use of  individual underwriting  techniques for  group major  medical business,
which is included in the Company's employer-employee group health product line.
The legislation  permits carriers  to use  pre-existing condition exclusions to
protect against adverse selection, but prohibits the use of age and sex factors
in rating and requires that average rates be used for the aforementioned plans.
Similar legislation  is contemplated  or has  been  enacted  in  various  other
states, and  various health  care reform  proposals have emerged at the Federal
level.   In response  to  current  and  anticipated  health  insurance  reform,
particularly at the state level, the Company announced in December 1993 that it
would restrict  its sales of new major medical business to 21 states, including
New York,  in which  it has  a significant  amount of  in force business, while
continuing renewals  of this  business in all states.  During 1993, a number of
modifications were  introduced to  the Company's  stand-alone group  life, long
term disability  and dental  insurance products with the goal of increasing the
proportion of  business from  non-major medical  lines.   Based on  preliminary
analysis, the  Company does  not currently anticipate a material adverse impact
on its  consolidated operations to result from enacted state legislation or the
actions taken  with respect to this line of business.  The Company continues to
carefully monitor  developments in  the health  care reform area and to explore
its alternatives,  but cannot  predict how  legislative changes  at the Federal
level will  affect its  business in  the health insurance area unless and until
such changes are adopted.
<PAGE>19

     The individual  accident and  health product  line consists  primarily  of
certain specialty  products and  coverages issued  upon conversion  of  certain
group health  insurance products.   The pre-tax loss recorded in 1992 reflected
poor morbidity  experience on  specialty products  included in  this line.  The
1993 loss  was primarily  attributed to  results on coverages issued upon group
health conversions.

     Credit disability  insurance is  written in  conjunction with  credit life
insurance and covers the continuation of loan payments to a lender in the event
the borrower  becomes disabled.  The 1992 decrease in credit disability pre-tax
income reflected  a reduced  level of  earned  premium  and  temporary  expense
increases associated with the combination of operations of two of the Company's
credit insurance  subsidiaries.   The improved  results in  1993 reflected more
favorable morbidity experience versus the preceding year.



  Investments and Investment Results

     Investments are  subject to  the direction  and control  of the  Boards of
Directors or  Executive Committees  of each  of the  respective Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries.   Many investments  are made  upon the  recommendation of  USLIFE
Realty Corporation  or USLIFE  Real Estate  Services Corporation  (see  "Realty
Investment" below)  with respect  to real  estate and  mortgages, and  upon the
recommendation of  the parent  company with respect to securities, all of which
furnish such  investment advice  to  the  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries.    All
investments must  comply with  applicable insurance laws and regulations, which
prescribe the  nature, quality  and percentages of various types of investments
which may be made by insurance companies.  The major portion of funds available
for investment  in recent  years has  been invested  in  bonds  and  redeemable
preferred stocks ("Fixed Maturities"), and in short term investments, including
corporate commercial paper and money market instruments.

     Effective December  31, 1992,  Fixed Maturities which may be sold prior to
maturity as  a result  of the  Company's investment  strategies are  considered
available for  sale and  carried at  the lower  of aggregate  amortized cost or
market value  as of  the balance  sheet date.   As  discussed below,  valuation
reserves are  maintained for  Fixed Maturities  and other  investments  with  a
reduction in  value determined  to be  other than  temporary.  During the first
quarter of  1994, the  Company will  adopt Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No.  115, "Accounting  for Certain  Investments in  Debt  and  Equity
Securities,"  which   will  require   most  of  the  Company's  Fixed  Maturity
investments to  be carried  at market  value.  Common stocks and non-redeemable
preferred stocks  ("Equity Securities")  are carried  at market.  See Note 1 of
Notes to Financial Statements for further information.

     The mortgage portfolios of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 had  an aggregate  principal amount  of  approximately  $386  million  and
consisted of  approximately 321  loans.   The mortgage  portfolio of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  is characterized  by a broad geographical distribution,
with approximately  6% of total book value at December 31, 1993 relating to the
New England  region of  the United States, 16% from the middle-Atlantic states,
23% from the north-central states, 16% from the south-Atlantic states, 10% from
the south-central  states, 14%  from the  mountain states,  and  15%  from  the
Pacific states.  Based on book value, approximately 40% of these mortgage loans
at that  date are  secured by  office buildings,  24% by industrial / warehouse
properties, 25%  retail, 1%  apartments, 2% one to four family residential, and
the remainder  secured by hotel / motel, medically oriented, or other specialty
properties.   At December  31, 1993,  the average principal balance of mortgage
loans contained  in the  portfolio was  $1.2 million,  with a  weighted average
yield of  9.82% on book value.  The average maturity was approximately 7 years.
The largest  principal balance  of any  single mortgage  loan at  that date was
$12.3 million.   The  Company regards  delinquent mortgage loans to be those on
which interest due is unpaid for 60 days or more or the loan is in foreclosure.
The book value of delinquent mortgage loans amounted to approximately 7.31% and
5.52%  of   the  mortgage  loan  portfolio  at  December  31,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.  On December 31, 1993 property held as a result of foreclosure of
loans amounted to $25 million.

     The bond portfolios of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 were predominantly comprised of investment grade securities (based on
ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies and insurance regulatory
authorities).  At December 31, 1993, invested assets of the Life Insurance
<PAGE>20

Subsidiaries included  approximately $203  million  book  value  of  less  than
investment grade  corporate securities,  based on  such ratings.    The  latter
investments had  an aggregate  market value of approximately $213 million as of
December 31,  1993 and  based on  book value,  represent approximately  3.1% of
total assets of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at that date.  These securities
generally provide  higher yields and involve greater risk of loss from borrower
default than  investment grade  securities because their issuers typically have
higher levels  of indebtedness  and are  more vulnerable  to  adverse  economic
conditions than other issuers.  The results of operations of the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries historically  have not  reflected a  material adverse  impact from
investment in such securities.  Certain bonds, representing less than 1% of the
total bond  portfolio for  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries,  have defaulted in
interest.   Quality ratings  of the  fixed maturities  portfolio  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  at December  31, 1993  with respect  to  each  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners  (NAIC) credit classification, based on
book value, are as follows:

     The  Company's  management  of  the  investment  portfolios  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries includes identification and evaluation of holdings which
are non-performing  or have otherwise indicated performance which could imperil
future investment  income or recovery of invested amounts.  A valuation reserve
is maintained for those investments where a reduction of value is determined to
be other  than temporary.   In 1993, net additions to the valuation reserve for
fixed maturity  investments (on  a pre-tax basis) amounted to $7.6 million, and
$25.0 million  was added  to such  reserves relating  to real  estate, mortgage
loans, and  other long  term investments.    In  1992,  net  additions  to  the
valuation reserve  for fixed maturity investments (on a pre-tax basis) amounted
to $153 thousand, and $23.0 million was added to such reserves relating to real
estate, mortgage  loans, and  other  long  term  investments.    In  1991,  net
additions to the valuation reserve for fixed maturity investments (on a pre-tax
basis) amounted  to $8.5  million, and  $7.1 million was added to such reserves
relating to  real estate  and other  long  term  investments.    Total  pre-tax
portfolio reserves  for the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries  amounted  to  $125.2
million at  December 31, 1993.  The Company believes that adequate reserves for
losses have been established.

________

     (1) Does  not include  adjustments for  net unrealized gains and losses on
marketable equity  securities.  See Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements for
further information.

     (2) Net  investment income  is after  deduction of investment expenses but
before realized capital gains or losses and federal income taxes.

     (3) Calculated  on the  basis of  a formula  prescribed  by  the  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners  which computes  the yield  on the mean
asset values during the year.

     (4) The  1992 and  1991 net  realized losses  reflected  the  disposal  of
certain real  estate properties  and additions  to the  valuation reserves  for
certain investments which, in the aggregate, more than offset $23.3 million and
$19.4 million  gross pre-tax  capital gains,  respectively, from  disposals  of
fixed maturity investments.

The investment  management policies  of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries include
continual evaluation of securities market conditions and circumstances relating
to particular  investment holdings  which may  result  in  selection  of  fixed
maturity or  other investments for sale prior to maturity.  Securities may also
be sold  as part  of the  Company's asset  / liability  management strategy  in
response to  changes in  interest rates, resultant prepayment risk, and similar
factors.  The net yield on cash and invested assets declined from 8.95% in 1991
to 8.76%  in 1992 and 8.35% in 1993, as a continuing decline in market interest
rates has resulted in calls of higher yielding securities out of the investment
portfolio and  the reinvestment  of proceeds  from these securities, as well as
funds provided  from operations,  at lower  available current  rates.   In this
connection, it  should be  noted that  the Company's liability for policyholder
account balances,  amounting to  $3.3 billion  and $2.9 billion at December 31,
1993 and  1992, respectively,  relates to interest sensitive life insurance and
annuity contracts  that are subject to periodic adjustment of credited interest
rates.   Credited interest  rates are determined by management based on factors
including available  market interest  rates  and  portfolio  rates  of  return.
Interest rates  credited on  the  Company's  interest  sensitive  products  are
sensitive to changes in interest rates earned on the Company's investments.  As
discussed in  Management's Discussion  and Analysis  of "Results of Operations"
herein, the  interest rates  credited on  the Company's  deferred  annuity  and
universal life  products have  declined in 1991, 1992 and 1993.  These declines
generally follow the pattern of declining yields on the assets supporting these
liabilities.   As discussed  under  "Regulation"  herein,  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries have  complied for  statement years  1993 and  1992 with valuation
actuary testing  requirements, promulgated  by the  NAIC, which apply specified
rules to  assess the  impact of various interest rate scenarios on the adequacy
of assets  to meet  policyholder liabilities.  These tests did not disclose any
failure of  the Company's  assets to  support its  policy liabilities under the
NAIC specified testing scenarios.

<PAGE>22


  Reserves and Reinsurance

     In accordance  with applicable  law, the  Life Insurance Subsidiaries have
set up  and carry actuarial reserves to meet their obligations on their various
policies.   These reserves  are amounts  which, together  with  additions  from
premiums to  be received  and interest  on such reserves compounded annually at
certain assumed  rates, are  calculated to  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries'  policy obligations as they mature.   The liability for
policy benefits  relating to  cash values  of interest  sensitive  products  is
accumulated based  on credited  rates of interest which are subject to periodic
adjustment.   The statutory  reserves of  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are
certified by internal actuaries as permitted by state insurance departments and
are not  specifically examined  by independent  actuaries.   The Life Insurance
Subsidiaries generally  reinsure risks  over $1.5  million as  well as selected
risks of lesser amounts.  See Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.


  Employees and Agents

     At December  31, 1993,  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries had approximately
1,500 regular employees at their home and regional offices, and individual life
insurance policies  were sold  principally through  approximately 600  agencies
located throughout  the United  States.   As discussed below, services are also
furnished  to   the  Life   Insurance  Subsidiaries  by  the  Company's  Realty
Investment, Securities  Investment, and Corporate Services subsidiaries, and by
USLIFE Corporation.

     With few  exceptions,  the  general  agents  and  producers  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  are independent  contractors and  are compensated  on a
commission basis  within limitations set by applicable insurance laws.  Service
fees and  expense reimbursement  allowances are  paid to  general agents,  also
within the  limitations of  applicable insurance  laws.   A large percentage of
producers also sell for other companies.


  Home Offices

     The home  office of  United States  Life is  located in  a  portion  of  a
building at 125 Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038.  In December 1986 United
States Life  sold this  building and leased back portions of the premises which
are utilized  as its  principal executive  offices as  well  as  the  principal
executive offices  of USLIFE,  USLIFE Equity  Sales Corporation,  USLIFE Realty
Corporation, USLIFE Advisers, Inc. and an office of USLIFE Systems Corporation.
The leases  for space occupied by United States Life and other USLIFE companies
expire in  1996.   Present annual  base rent  for all  such companies  is  $3.7
million, subject  to adjustment,  tax and escalation clauses.  Certain of these
leases provide  for renewal options for two successive ten year terms, based on
fair rental  value at  the time  of renewal.  The group insurance operations of
United States  Life, certain  other clerical  and  administrative  units  which
provide support  services for  that company  and certain  other Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries, and  several corporate  units are  located in  a building at 3600
Route 66,  Neptune, New  Jersey 07754.   This  building is rented under a lease
expiring in  2003 with renewal options for two additional five year terms and a
further option  relating to rental of additional office space.  The annual base
rent under this lease is approximately $2.3 million, subject to adjustment, tax
and escalation  clauses.   See Note  8 of  Notes to  Financial  Statements  for
further information regarding the Company's lease commitments.

     The home  office of Old Line Life is located at 707 North Eleventh Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin  53233, in  a building  which it  owns.   This property is
considered adequate for the purpose used and excess space is rented to others.

     The home office of All American Life is located in a portion of a building
at 8501  West Higgins  Road, Chicago,  Illinois 60631,  rented  under  a  lease
expiring in  2001 with  a renewal option for an additional five year term.  The
annual base rent is approximately $481 thousand and is subject to increases due
to increases  in taxes  and operating expenses of the building.  The offices of
USLIFE Insurance  Services Corporation  and certain  other USLIFE  subsidiaries
which provide  services to  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are located  in a
portion of a building at 1355 River Bend Drive, Dallas, Texas 75247.  The space
occupied by the USLIFE companies in the latter premises is rented under a lease
expiring in  1997 providing  two successive  five year  renewal  options,  with
annual base  rent of  approximately $810  thousand subject  to  adjustment  and
escalation clauses.   The  home office  of USLIFE Credit Life is located at One
Woodfield Lake,  Schaumburg, Illinois  60173, rented  under a lease expiring in
2000 with a five year renewal option.  The annual base rent under this lease is
approximately $1 million, subject to certain adjustment and escalation clauses.
<PAGE>23


  Regulation

     The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision
by the supervisory agency of each state or other jurisdiction in which they are
licensed to  do business.  These supervisory agencies have broad administrative
powers relating  to  the  granting  and  revocation  of  licenses  to  transact
business, the  licensing of  agents, the  approval  of  policy  forms,  premium
levels, the  form and content of mandatory financial statements (see "Insurance
Accounting" in  Note 1  of Notes  to Financial  Statements), capital,  surplus,
reserve requirements  and the  types of  investments which  may be  made.   The
National Association  of Insurance  Commissioners ("NAIC")  recommended in 1992
certain  new   regulatory  reporting   requirements  for  insurance  companies,
including "valuation actuary" and "risk-based capital" requirements.  Under the
valuation  actuary   requirement,  the   company  must   provide  an  actuary's
certification of  the adequacy  of  reserves  for  future  liabilities,  taking
account of  the assets  that support  them,  under  various  possible  economic
scenarios.   As indicated  under "Investments and Investment Results," the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries have satisfactorily complied with these requirements for
statement years  1993 and 1992.  The risk-based capital requirements, effective
with statement  year 1993,  require the company to demonstrate that capital and
surplus meet  or exceed  formula-driven standards based on exposure to specific
categories of  risk.   Companies that do not meet a standard of at least a 200%
ratio of  "Total Adjusted  Capital" to  "Authorized  Control  Level  Risk-Based
Capital," as  defined by  regulatory authorities,  are identified as candidates
for various levels of regulatory action, ranging from increased surveillance to
state insurance  department control.   At  December 31,  1993, each of the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  exceeded the  required risk-based  capital ratios, with
each ratio  (as defined)  in excess  of 400%.   The Life Insurance Subsidiaries
have not  experienced  and  do  not  anticipate  an  adverse  impact  on  their
operations as  a consequence  of the  valuation actuary  and risk-based capital
requirements.   As specified  by the  NAIC,  Insurance  Regulatory  Information
System ("IRIS")  ratios of certain key statutory data are computed for the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  on an  annual basis.  These ratios revealed no material
exceptions for  statement year  1993.   The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries may be
required, under  the solvency  or guaranty  laws of the various states in which
they are  licensed,  to  pay  assessments  up  to  prescribed  limits  to  fund
policyholder losses  or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies.  The Life
Insurance  Subsidiaries  are  required  to  file  detailed  reports  with  each
supervisory agency,  and their  books and records are subject to examination by
each.   In accordance  with the insurance codes in the states in which they are
domiciled and  the rules and practices of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries are  examined periodically  by
examiners of  the states in which they are domiciled and by representatives (on
an "association"  or "zone"  basis) of  the other  states  in  which  they  are
licensed to  do business.   All  of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries have been
examined at least as of December 31, 1990.

     Annual  financial   statements  prepared   in  accordance  with  statutory
accounting practices  for each  of the  Company's Life  Insurance Subsidiaries,
filed prior  to 1992  with  insurance  departments  in  the  states  where  the
Company's Life Insurance Subsidiaries are domiciled or licensed to do business,
required the  inclusion of  a mandatory  securities valuation reserve ("MSVR").
This reserve  was designed  to stabilize statutory surplus against fluctuations
in the  market values  of stocks and bonds, according to regulations prescribed
by the  NAIC.  Commencing with statement year 1992, the NAIC replaced MSVR with
two reserves,  the interest  maintenance reserve  ("IMR") and  asset  valuation
reserve ("AVR").   The new regulations apply to all invested assets and require
that investment  gains and  losses resulting  from changes in interest rates be
distinguished from gains and losses resulting from changes in creditworthiness.
The IMR  captures all  investment gains  and losses  resulting from  changes in
interest rates  and provides  for subsequent  amortization of such amounts into
statutory net  income on  a basis  reflecting the remaining lives of the assets
sold.   The AVR  captures investment  gains and  losses related  to changes  in
creditworthiness and  will be  adjusted each year based on a formula related to
the quality  and loss  experience of  the Company's  investment portfolio.  The
AVR, unlike  the MSVR  which was  applicable only  to fixed maturity and equity
security investments,  requires reserves  for mortgage  loans,  other  invested
assets and  short-term investments.   The  AVR and  IMR are  not recorded under
generally accepted  accounting principles  and consequently  have no  impact on
reported financial  position or  results of  operations of  the Company.    The
Company has  not experienced  any significant  adverse impact  on  its  overall
operations as a result of these regulatory accounting changes and, based on the
current  composition  of  the  investment  portfolios  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries, the  Company does  not currently  anticipate significant  adverse
impact.
<PAGE>24

     Most states have enacted legislation or adopted administrative regulations
covering such  matters as the acquisition of control of insurance companies and
transactions between insurance companies and the persons controlling them.  The
National  Association   of  Insurance   Commissioners  has   recommended  model
legislation on  these subjects which has been adopted, with variations, by many
states.     The  nature  and  extent  of  the  legislation  and  administrative
regulations now  in effect  vary from  state to  state, and in most states they
require administrative  approval of  the acquisition of control of an insurance
company incorporated  in the  state,  whether  by  tender  offer,  exchange  of
securities, merger or otherwise, and require the filing of detailed information
regarding the  acquiring parties  and the plan of acquisition.  Every insurance
company which  is authorized  to do business in the state and is a member of an
"insurance holding  company system,"  other  than  a  company  incorporated  in
another state  subject to  substantially similar  disclosure  requirements  and
standards, is  generally required  to  register  as  such  with  the  insurance
regulatory authorities  and file  periodic reports concerning its relationships
with the insurance holding company and other affiliates of the holding company.
Material transactions between registered insurance companies and members of the
holding company  system are  required to  be "fair  and reasonable" and in some
cases are  subject to  administrative approval,  and the  books,  accounts  and
records of  each party  are required  to be  so maintained  as to  clearly  and
accurately disclose the precise nature and details of the transactions.  Notice
to or  approval by  regulatory authorities is frequently required for dividends
paid by  insurance companies,  and their  surplus  following  any  dividend  is
required to  be reasonable  in relation to outstanding liabilities and adequate
for financial  needs.   See "Insurance  Accounting"  in  Note  1  of  Notes  to
Financial Statements  for  further  information  regarding  dividends.    Broad
examination and  enforcement powers  are conferred  on regulatory  authorities.
Each of  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries is required to register as a member of
an insurance  holding company system with the insurance supervisory authorities
in at  least one  state.  USLIFE does not presently anticipate that legislation
and regulation  such as  that described  above  will  materially  restrict  its
activities.

     Acquired Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS),  which  has  received  wide
publicity because  of its  serious public health implications, presents special
concerns to  the life  insurance industry.   Morbidity  and mortality risks are
accepted  by   insurers  based   on  methods   of  classification  designed  to
appropriately relate  premiums charged  to such  risks and, in this connection,
steps have  been taken  toward strengthening  the  Company's  underwriting  and
selection process.   The  Company's  own  mortality  and  morbidity  experience
reflects no  significant adverse impact as a result of any acceleration of AIDS
claims.   The Company is continuing to monitor developments in this area but is
necessarily unable  to predict the long term impact of this problem on the life
insurance industry generally or on the Company.


  Competition

     The insurance  business is highly competitive, and there are approximately
2,000 stock  and mutual  companies some  of which  are  larger  than  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  (individually and  in the  aggregate).   Although  most
insurance  companies   are  stock   companies,  mutual  companies  account  for
approximately 40%  of the life insurance in force in the United States and hold
a still  larger  percentage  of  the  admitted  assets.    The  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries believe  that their  premium  rates  and  policies  are  generally
competitive with those of other life insurance companies.

     If the  aggregate volume  of insurance  in force  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries were considered to be that of one company, such company would have
ranked 19th  among the  United States  companies listed in surveys contained in
the June  21, 1993  edition  of  the  National  Underwriter,  Life  and  Health
Insurance Edition.   In addition to competition among life insurance companies,
the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries also compete increasingly with other financial
institutions such  as commercial  banks and securities brokerage organizations.
Competition from  such  financial  institutions  as  well  as  other  insurance
companies is  considered by  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries in determining the
rates of  return to  be offered on interest sensitive products.  See discussion
under "Additions and Terminations."

Realty Investment

  USLIFE Realty Corporation; USLIFE Real Estate Services Corporation

     USLIFE Realty  Corporation ("Realty")  was incorporated  in 1954.   Realty

estate standby  commitments for  fees which  may include  the receipt of equity
interests and participates in real estate joint ventures relating to properties

investment,  remain   the  responsibility  of  the  individual  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries.   USLIFE Real  Estate Services Corporation also provides services

Securities Investment

  USLIFE Advisers, Inc.

     USLIFE Advisers,  Inc. ("Advisers"),  a wholly-owned subsidiary of USLIFE,
was incorporated  in October 1972 to be the adviser to USLIFE Income Fund, Inc.
("Income Fund"),  a closed-end  mutual fund sponsored by USLIFE.  Income Fund's
primary investment  objective is  to provide  a high level of current income to
its shareholders.   Income  Fund made  a public  offering of  its securities in
December 1972  and had  net assets of approximately $58 million at December 31,
1993.   Advisers' services  to Income  Fund are  furnished under  an investment
advisory contract  which, as  required by  the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
provides that its continuance is subject to specific approval at least annually
by a  majority of  the Directors  of Income  Fund, including  a majority of its
directors who  are not  parties to  such agreement or interested persons of any
such party,  or by  vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of  Income Fund,  and to  termination by  either party  on 60  days'
notice.   In 1993,  Advisers earned  fees of  $400 thousand  pursuant  to  this
contract.

     Descriptions of properties of USLIFE and its subsidiaries are set forth in
Item 1.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.


In November  1981 the  Company and  certain of  its subsidiaries  filed a third
amended complaint against a former registered representative and certain of his
affiliated companies  and individuals  and against  certain former  officers of
USLIFE Savings  and Loan  Association ("USLIFE Savings", a former subsidiary of
the Company)  for indemnification,  injunctive relief  and  accounting  (USLIFE
Savings and  Loan Association  v. Louis  Wilcox, et  al., Superior Court of the
State of  California for  the County  of Riverside).   In  the  complaint,  the
Company, its  subsidiaries and USLIFE Savings sought to recover all damages and
losses incurred  by them  as defendants in actions related to the activities of
the aforementioned  former registered representative as well as attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in defending against such actions.  In April 1984, defendant
Louis M. Wilcox, a former officer of USLIFE Savings, filed a cross complaint in
this action.   Wilcox  seeks special damages in the amount of not less than $15
thousand, general  damages of  $1 million, and punitive damages of $10 million.
In 1986  Wilcox's causes  of action  for malicious  prosecution  and  abuse  of
process were  dismissed.  In 1989 Wilcox voluntarily dismissed the remainder of
his case  and appealed  the 1986  decision dismissing his  causes of action for
malicious prosecution  and abuse  of process.   On appeal, the dismissal of the
cause of  action for abuse of process was reversed.  The dismissal of the cause
of action  for malicious  prosecution was upheld.  Trial was scheduled to begin
in June  1993.   Pursuant to the Company's request, the case was bifurcated for
trial.   In July  1993 the  trial court,  after hearing  evidence on the issue,
without a  jury, decided  that the Company originally had probable cause to sue
Wilcox.   As this  was dispositive of Wilcox's claim for malicious prosecution,
the Court  dismissed Wilcox's  claims against  the Company.   A judgment in the
Company's favor was entered in late 1993.  Wilcox has appealed.


In March 1992, All American Life Insurance Company ("All American") terminated
the right of Doug Ruedlinger, Inc. (the "Managing General Agent" or "DRI") to
sell college medical insurance on behalf of All American.  All American had
entered into an arrangement with the Managing General Agent for sales and the
administration of student accident and health policies, embodied in an
Exclusive Agency Agreement.  In April 1992, All American terminated the
Managing General Agent's Exclusive Agency Agreement.  The Exclusive Agency
Agreement was terminated as a result of the failure of the Managing General
Agent to secure adequate reinsurance as required under that contract, and to
meet other contractual obligations.  Subsequent to the termination of the
Exclusive Agency Agreement, the Managing General Agent ceased processing and
paying claims under All American policies, and All American assumed these
functions.  The Managing General Agent then commenced arbitration proceedings
against All American before the American Arbitration Association based upon the
termination of the Exclusive Agency Agreement (the "Arbitration Proceeding").
<PAGE>27

All American then commenced an action against the Managing General Agent in the
United States  District Court  for the  District of  Kansas (All  American Life
Insurance Co.  v. Doug  Ruedlinger, Inc.  and First Benefits, Inc. ("FBI") (the
"Kansas litigation") seeking a Temporary Restraining Order (which was granted),
and damages  for breach  of contract and breach of fiduciary duty; All American
also secured  a preliminary  injunction prohibiting  the Managing General Agent
from, among  other things, collecting premiums, placing any insurance on behalf
of All American, or in any way holding itself out as representing All American.
All American  subsequently filed  an amended  complaint adding corporations and
individuals affiliated with the Managing General Agent as party defendants (the
"Ruedlinger Defendants") and alleging claims ranging from civil RICO violations
to a  claim for  common law  fraud.   The Managing  General Agent's  Errors and
Omissions carrier,  Transamerica Insurance Company ("Transamerica"), intervened
in the  Kansas litigation  to deny coverage for the claims asserted against the
Managing General Agent in the Arbitration Proceeding and the Kansas litigation,
which allegedly  fell under the coverage of Transamerica's Errors and Omissions
Policy (the  "Policy").  In March 1993, All American entered into an Assignment
Agreement with  Merchants National  Bank  ("Merchants"  or,  the  "Bank")  (the
Managing General  Agent's former  bank).   The Bank  had  asserted  a  security
interest in  premiums and  reinsurance recoveries on the policies at issue, and
had intervened  in the  Kansas litigation  seeking  to  enforce  these  alleged
security interests.   Through  the Assignment Agreement, All American purchased
all of  the Bank's  right, title  and interest  in and  to the Managing General
Agent's assets, as well as the assets of its parent and affiliates, pursuant to
certain loan  documents executed  by the  Managing General Agent and its parent
and affiliates.   Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, all claims
asserted by  All American and the Bank, against each other, were dismissed.  By
consent order  dated May  25, 1993,  the Kansas  litigation was  stayed by  the
Court.   The Court in the Kansas litigation lifted the stay in that case solely
to permit All American to file a second amended complaint in that action, which
was identical  to the  prior pleading  except that  it set  forth an additional
claim against  an affiliate  of the  Managing  General  Agent,  Fund  Insurance
Company, Ltd.  ("FICL"), based  on a  promissory note  that was assigned to All
American by  the Bank  under the  Assignment Agreement.    FICL  is  a  Bermuda
insurance company that was already a defendant in the Kansas litigation, and is
owned by  a Kansas corporation known as The Ruedlinger Company, Inc.  Among the
loan documents  assigned to All American by the Bank pursuant to the Assignment
Agreement was  a written  guaranty by  Douglas  O.  Ruedlinger  ("Ruedlinger"),
guarantying the  full indebtedness represented by the loan documents.  Prior to
the execution  and delivery of the Assignment Agreement, the Bank had commenced
an action  against Ruedlinger  in the  Kansas State  Court of  Shawnee  County,
Merchants National  Bank v.  Douglas O.  Ruedlinger,  92CV1432  based  on  that
guaranty (the  "Guaranty  Action").    In  April  1993,  after  the  Assignment
Agreement, All  American was  substituted as  plaintiff in  that action.    All
American then  moved for  summary judgment,  and by  Order and  Judgment  dated
September 15,  1993, the  Court awarded  All American  final  judgment  against
Ruedlinger personally  for an amount in excess of $2.4 million.  Ruedlinger has
filed an appeal of that judgment.

The arbitration  hearings between  All American and the Managing General Agent,
which began  in October  1992, and  which by  January 1993  were  substantially
completed (the  "Arbitration Proceeding"),  were effectively  stayed on January
19, 1993,  when  the  Managing  General  Agent,  and  its  captive  third-party
administration  affiliate  FBI,  filed  Chapter  11  reorganization  bankruptcy
petitions (the  "DRI Bankruptcy  Cases").   In April 1993, the Bankruptcy Court
converted those bankruptcy reorganization proceedings to Chapter 7 liquidations
and appointed a trustee to administer the debtors' estates (the "DRI Trustee").
All American  moved in those bankruptcy proceedings to lift the stay imposed by
the bankruptcy  filings to  permit the  Arbitration Proceeding to be concluded,
which motion was granted by the Court in August 1993.

In December 1993, All American negotiated a settlement with the DRI Trustee and
Transamerica in the DRI Bankruptcy Cases (the "DRI Bankruptcy Settlement").
Under the terms of that settlement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court
at a hearing on December 16, 1993, and later by written order dated January 25,
1994, all claims asserted, or which could have been asserted against All
American by DRI, FBI, the DRI Trustee and Transamerica were dismissed, with
prejudice.  In addition, the DRI Trustee consented to the entry of an award in
the Arbitration Proceeding whereby: (i) the arbitrators would find in favor of
All American on all of its claims, including a finding that the termination of
DRI's Exclusive Agency Agreement was proper and for cause; (ii) finding against
DRI on all of its claims; and (iii) further entering a monetary award in All
American's favor against DRI and FBI in the sum of $17 million (the "General
Claim").  Also in connection with the DRI Bankruptcy Settlement, Transamerica
agreed to pay to All American the sum of $200 thousand to settle All American's
<PAGE>28

claim under  Transamerica's Policy.   As  consideration for  this payment,  All
American agreed  to subordinate  its claims  to all other allowed claims in the
DRI Bankruptcy  Cases, and  to dismiss  and release certain claims against DRI,
FBI, and  certain of  the Ruedlinger  Defendants.   Expressly exempted from the
release were  claims against FICL, Ruedlinger in the Guaranty Action, Wheatland
and various  other entities  under the  Merchants loan  documents, and  various
other entities controlled by Ruedlinger.

On or about April 21, 1993, All American filed involuntary bankruptcy petitions
under Chapter  7 against  the  Managing  General  Agent's  parent  corporation,
Wheatland Group  Holdings, Inc.  ("Wheatland"), and  five of  its other  wholly
owned subsidiaries,  which were  also affiliates of the Managing General Agent.
Each of  the six  alleged debtors  moved to  dismiss the involuntary bankruptcy
petition filed  against it,  and All  American opposed  those motions.  After a
hearing before  the Court  on October  12, 1993,  by Judgment dated October 25,
1993, the  Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors' motions to dismiss, ruling that
All American  had properly  filed the  involuntary bankruptcy petitions against
each of the six debtors.  In November 1993, the Court entered orders for relief
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code against each of the involuntary debtors,
and appointed a Trustee to administer their estates.

In July  1993, the  Judge in an action entitled Sheldon Whitehouse, as Receiver
for United  International Insurance  Company ("UIIC") v. Douglas O. Ruedlinger,
et al., pending in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas,
92-4255 (RDR),  permitted the  plaintiff-Receiver to amend his complaint to add
All American  as a  defendant in  that case,  and to  assert claims against All
American for an accounting and for money damages, which complaint was served on
All American.   In  that action  it is  alleged that over $300 thousand in UIIC
premiums were used by FBI to pay All American insured's claims, and that UIIC's
Receiver is  entitled to  a refund  of those  funds.   All American  intends to
vigorously oppose  that action.  That action has also been stayed pursuant to a
separate consent order issued by the Court.  In August 1993, All American filed
a claim  in the UIIC receivership action in Rhode Island, in which All American
claimed that  $87 thousand  of its  premiums were  used by FBI to pay claims of
UIIC's insureds.   The  Receiver has  taken no  position with  respect to  this
claim.

In December  1993, All  American settled all potential claims by or against the
National Federation  of State High School Associations (the "Federation").  The
Federation was  an insured  under a  student accident medical payment insurance
policy placed  by DRI.   The policy provided excess insurance to the Federation
over a  55% self-insured  program for the Federation members.  All American and
the Federation  were involved  in a  dispute as to when All American's coverage
applied.   All American  contended that  its coverage  was excess  to the self-
insured program,  and the  Federation contended  that All  American's insurance
obligation was  primary coverage.   The  Federation also threatened to bring an
action against  All American  claiming that,  since June 1992, All American had
collected certain  premiums  directly  from  Federation  insureds  and  further
alleging that  part of those premiums were Federation member dues for the self-
insured program.   The  Federation threatened  to seek  an accounting  from All
American, and to the extent that DRI was All American's Managing General Agent,
the Federation  stated that  it would allege that All American was liable to it
for over  $1.5 million in Federation dues that were misappropriated by DRI.  In
July  1992,   All  American  entered  into  a  standstill  agreement  with  the
Federation, which  provided that  All American  would advance claim payments to
Federation insureds  for all claims under both the self-insured program and All
American's insurance policy, subject to the resolution of the coverage dispute.
All American  advanced over $750 thousand for such claim payments.  In December
1993, All American settled all claims by and against the Federation whereby the
Federation has  agreed to  pay $100  thousand to  All American in installments.
The Federation  and All  American have  agreed to  exchange general releases as
part of this settlement.

Starting in June 1991, and through April 1992, DRI filed several claims with
reinsurers of All American's insurance under reinsurance treaties issued for
the school years 1988-1989, 1989-1990, and 1990-1991.  As of June 1992, the
outstanding reinsurance claims filed by DRI totalled to approximately $3.5
million.  After a preliminary audit of DRI conducted by the reinsurers in
February 1992, the reinsurers informed DRI that they would not pay any further
claims until a full audit was completed.  Among the questions raised by the
reinsurers at that audit were (i) whether DRI improperly included a 5% TPA fee
as part of loss adjustment expense when filing the aggregate stop loss claims;
(ii) whether the reinsurance treaties covered illness claims; and (iii) whether
DRI's tack-on premiums should have been included in calculating the premium
<PAGE>29

component of  the stop  loss policies'  attachment point,  and the  reinsurance
premiums.   The reinsurers  claim that all three procedures were improper.  All
American had  demanded payment  of these outstanding claims, which is currently
the subject  of negotiations  between All American and the reinsurers.  Certain
of the  reinsurers have  settled with  All American, which when completed, will
represent payments  to All  American of  over $230  thousand.  Other reinsurers
have indicated that they will demand the refund of sums previously paid by them
to DRI  on certain  aggregate claims that the reinsurers contend were improper.
All American  submitted claims  to the  reinsurers for  the 1991-1992  year  of
account totalling  over $3  million on  an excess  of loss treaty in effect for
this period.  These reinsurers, which for the most part were different from the
prior years'  reinsurers, denied  coverage for  the vast majority of the claims
submitted and refused to pay any claims without a thorough audit.  All American
has  reached   settlements  with   reinsurers  possessing   over  85%   of  the
participation interests  in this period's treaties by agreeing to rescind these
treaties, which  have resulted  in premium  refund  payments  to  All  American
totalling over $900 thousand.  All American is continuing to negotiate with the
remaining  few   reinsurers.     All  American's   likelihood   of   recovering
significantly more of these reinsurance billings is currently uncertain.

All American  has taken  a one-time,  after-tax  charge  of  $10.6  million  to
establish a  reserve for  amounts receivable  from the  Managing General Agent.
Management is  of the opinion that any additional losses that might be suffered
will not  have a  material adverse impact on the consolidated Equity Capital of
the Company.


In April  1991, All  American commenced  a lawsuit  against 11 subscribers to a
reinsurance pool  when the  reinsurers failed  to honor their obligations under
the reinsurance  agreement.   Approximately $15.8  million of  reinsured claims
were in  dispute.   All American's  complaint sought  declaratory  relief,  and
damages for  breach of contract and the reinsurers' duty of good faith and fair
dealing (All  American Life  Insurance  Company,  et  al.  v.  Beneficial  Life
Insurance Company, et al., U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey).
All of the defendants in the All American action asserted counterclaims against
All American  based  upon  its  alleged  failure  to  properly  administer  the
reinsured policies.   Certain  other common  law claims  were also asserted.  A
total of  eight of  the reinsurers  commenced their  own lawsuits  against  All
American, among  others, arising  out of the same transactions.  Seven of those
brought an  action entitled  Mutual Benefit  Life Insurance  Company, et al. v.
George G. Zimmerman, et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey.   The Mutual  Benefit complaint  sought rescission  of the  reinsurance
agreement, as  well as  compensatory and  punitive damages, based upon asserted
federal and  New Jersey  state RICO  claims and  other common  law  claims  for
relief.   All of the defendants in the Mutual Benefit action also cross-claimed
against each  other for  contribution or  indemnification.  An eighth reinsurer
commenced a  further lawsuit  arising out  of the same transactions, naming All
American, among others, as a defendant (Security Benefit Life Insurance Company
v. All  American Life  Insurance Company,  et al,  U.S. District  Court for the
District of New Jersey).  The Security Benefit complaint sought only rescission
of the  reinsurance agreement  and declaratory  relief as against All American.
Certain of  the other defendants in the Security Benefit action asserted cross-
claims against  All American  for contribution  or indemnification.  All of the
lawsuits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the District
of New  Jersey, Newark Division.  All American has now reached settlements with
all of the reinsurers.  All direct claims concerning All American in the Mutual
Benefit and  Security Benefit  actions have  been dismissed.   The consolidated
actions are  currently in  the discovery  phase and  no date for trial has been
set.   All American  has  moved  to  dismiss  the  remaining  cross-claims  for
contribution or indemnity asserted against it, but that motion has not yet been
decided by the Court.

In June 1993 a purported class action (Hoban v. USLIFE Credit Life Insurance
Company, All American Life Insurance Company and Security of America Life
Insurance Company) was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois.  An Amended Complaint was filed in October 1993.
The Amended Complaint alleges that the defendant companies, all of which are
subsidiaries of USLIFE Corporation, sold single premium credit life and credit
disability insurance policies to second mortgage borrowers in several states.
The Amended Complaint further alleges that some second mortgage loans were paid
off early so that the insureds were legally entitled to refunds for unearned
premiums.  The suit seeks damages on behalf of those insureds who did not claim
and therefore did not receive partial refunds of their premiums from the named
defendants.  The Amended Complaint also contains claims under the Federal RICO
statute and the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act.  Defendants filed a Motion to
Dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of federal jurisdiction, for failure to
<PAGE>30

allege facts amounting to fraud, and for failure to allege facts amounting to a
RICO violation.   Plaintiff  has filed  a Motion  to Certify  the Class,  which
defendants opposed.  Both  motions are awaiting decision by the Court.

At this  point in time the outcome of these suits is not predictable.  However,
in the  opinion of  management, the  ultimate resolution  of these suits is not
likely to  have a material adverse affect on the consolidated Equity Capital of
the Company.

     For the  purposes of  complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Form S-8  (effective July  13, 1990)  under the  Securities Act  of  1933,  the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into registrant's Registration Statements on Form S-8
Nos. 33-40793  (filed June 23, 1991), 33-13999 (filed May 11, 1987) and 2-77278
(filed April 30, 1982):

     Insofar as  indemnification for  liabilities under  the Securities  Act of
1933 may  be permitted  to directors,  officers and  controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant  to the  foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been  advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification  is against  public policy  as expressed in the Securities
Act of  1933 and  is, therefore,  unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
indemnification against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant of  expenses incurred  or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of  the registrant  in the  successful defense  of any  action, suit  or
proceeding) is  asserted by  such director,  officer or  controlling person  in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion  of  its  counsel  the  matter  has  been  settled  by  controlling
precedent, submit  to a  court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

                  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
                                

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  USLIFE Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of USLIFE  Corporation and  subsidiaries as  of December 31, 1993
and 1992,  and the  related statements  of  consolidated  income,
equity capital,  and cash  flows for  each of  the years  in  the
three-year period  ended December  31, 1993.   These consolidated
financial statements  are the  responsibility  of  the  Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We  conducted   our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted auditing  standards.   Those standards  require that  we
plan and  perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether  the   financial  statements   are   free   of   material
misstatement.   An audit  includes examining,  on a  test  basis,
evidence supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.   An audit  also includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles used  and significant estimates made by management, as
well as  evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe  that our  audits provide  a reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

     In  our   opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements
referred to  above present  fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position  of USLIFE  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  at
December 31,  1993 and  1992, and the results of their operations
and their  cash flows  for each  of the  years in  the three-year
period ended  December 31,  1993, in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed  in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, the  Company changed  its method  of  accounting  for
postretirement benefits  other than pensions in 1992 to adopt the
provisions  of   the  Financial   Accounting  Standards   Board's
Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1.  Significant Accounting Policies


Changes in Accounting Principles

     Effective as  of the  first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial  Accounting Standards  No. 113  ("SFAS 113"), entitled "Accounting
and Reporting  for Reinsurance  of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts."
SFAS 113  requires that  assets and liabilities relating to reinsured contracts
be reported  on a  gross basis  rather than net of the impact of reinsurance as
permitted under  previous accounting  standards. The Statement also establishes
guidelines for  determining whether  risk is  transferred under  a  reinsurance
contract and  requires reinsurance  contracts which  do not qualify under these
guidelines to  be accounted  for as  deposits.   As a result of the adoption of
SFAS 113,  reinsurance receivables  amounting to approximately $135 million are
included  in   consolidated  total  assets  at  December  31,  1993,  including
approximately $118  million which  would have  been offset to various liability
accounts under  previous accounting  standards.   Other than the required gross
presentation of  reinsurance assets  and liabilities,  SFAS 113  did not have a
material impact  on the  Company's reported  financial position  or results  of
operations.   Financial statements  of previous  years were  not restated  as a
result of  the adoption  of SFAS  113.   See Note  10  of  Notes  to  Financial
Statements  for   further  information   regarding  the  Company's  reinsurance
contracts.

     Effective as  of January  1, 1992,  the Company implemented new accounting
standards for  non-pension postretirement  benefits required  by  Statement  of
Financial Accounting  Standards No.  106  ("SFAS  106"),  entitled  "Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and recognized the
initial liability  required by  SFAS 106  by means  of a one-time charge to net
income for  "cumulative effect  of accounting change." As required by SFAS 106,
this  charge,  which  amounted  to  $38.0  million  or  $1.67  per  share,  was
retroactively recorded  in the  first quarter  of 1992.  See Note 5 of Notes to
Financial   Statements    for   further   information   regarding   non-pension
postretirement benefits.

     Also in  1992, the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No.  109 ("SFAS  109"), entitled  "Accounting for  Income Taxes," and
restated, as  appropriate, the financial statements of previous years presented
to retroactively  give effect to the accounting standards required by SFAS 109.
See Note  4 of  Notes to Financial Statements for further information regarding
Federal income taxes.


Future Accounting Changes


     In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits."   Statement  No. 112,  which must  be implemented  in
1994, will  require advance  recognition of  non-retirement  benefits  such  as
severance pay  and health  insurance continuation  when certain  conditions are
met.   The adoption of Statement No. 112 will not have a material impact on the
Company's reported financial position or results of operations.

     In May  1993, FASB issued two additional Statements which will require the
Company to  adopt new  accounting and  reporting standards  in  preparation  of
future period financial statements.

     Statement No.  114, "Accounting  by Creditors  for Impairment  of a Loan,"
must be  adopted by  calendar year  enterprises no  later than  1995  and  will
require a  writedown to  fair value,  as defined  by the Statement, for certain
mortgage loans  and similar investments where impairment results in a change in
repayment terms.  Based on current evaluation of the Company's investments that
are covered  by this Statement, it is not anticipated to have a material impact
on the  Company's reported  financial position  or results  of operations.  The
Company has  not yet  determined the  timing of its implementation of Statement
No. 114.
<PAGE>52

     Statement No.  115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," will  require most  fixed maturity  investments to  be carried  at
market  value   commencing  in   1994.     It  is  currently  anticipated  that
substantially all  of the Company's fixed maturity investments will be included
in a  category established by the Statement that will require the securities to
be valued  at market,  with changes  in market value recognized through equity.
In addition  to application  of appropriate  tax effect,  the impact  on Equity
Capital from  this unrealized  appreciation may  also  be  subject  to  certain
additional adjustments  which have  not yet  been quantified  by  the  Company.
Market value  of these  securities exceeds  adjusted cost by approximately $380
million at  December 31, 1993.  The Company will adopt Statement No. 115 in the
first quarter  of 1994.   Adjustments  to market  value will  be required  each
quarter following  the implementation  of Statement  No. 115, resulting in both
increases and decreases to Equity Capital.


Basis of Consolidation

all of  its subsidiaries  (the "Company").   All  subsidiaries are  100 percent
owned.     All  material  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
eliminated.

Investments in Securities

     The Company's  investments in  preferred  stocks  (other  than  redeemable
preferred stocks) and common stocks ("Equity Securities") are carried at market
value in  the Consolidated  Balance Sheets at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991
and related  valuation allowances,  "Net unrealized losses on marketable equity
securities," in  the amounts  of $29 thousand, $165 thousand, and $13 thousand,
respectively, are  included in  Equity  Capital  at  those  dates.    Effective
December 31,  1992, Fixed  Maturity investments (including bonds and redeemable
preferred stocks)  which may  be sold  prior to  maturity as  a result  of  the
Company's investment  strategies are  considered available for sale and carried
at the  lower of  aggregate amortized  cost or  market value  as of the balance
sheet date.   The  Company's investment  management policies  include continual
monitoring and  evaluation of  securities market  conditions and  circumstances
relating to  its investment  holdings which  may result  in  the  selection  of
investments for sale prior to maturity.  Securities may also be sold as part of
the Company's  asset/liability management  strategy in  response to  changes in
interest  rates,   resultant  prepayment   risk,  and  similar  factors.    The
reclassification, as  of December  31, 1992,  of  the  Company's  entire  Fixed
Maturity portfolio to the "available for sale" category did not affect reported
net income, and this classification had no impact on Equity Capital at December
31, 1993  or 1992  as the  aggregate market  value of these securities exceeded

<PAGE>54
their amortized  cost at  those dates.   Valuation  reserves are maintained for
investments with  a reduction  in value  determined to be other than temporary.
The cost  and market  values of the Company's consolidated investments in Fixed
Maturities and  Equity Securities  at December  31, 1993,  1992  and  1991  are

     At December  31, 1993, consolidated invested assets included approximately
$221 million  book value  of less  than investment  grade corporate securities,
based  on   ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and  insurance
regulatory authorities.   Such  investments had  an aggregate  market value  of
approximately $232  million at  December 31,  1993 and,  based on  book  value,
represent approximately  3.3%  of  consolidated  total  assets  at  that  date.
Approximately $28  million book  value of  these investments  are classified as
problem securities  at that date and, of that amount, approximately $16 million
represented securities  in default  at December 31, 1993.  Also at December 31,
1993, the  book value  of mortgage  loans included in consolidated total assets
which were  60 days  or more delinquent or in foreclosure was approximately $26
million, and  the book  value  of  property  acquired  through  foreclosure  of
mortgage loans was approximately $25 million.

     Proceeds from disposals of investments in debt securities (excluding short
term commercial  paper) during  1993, 1992 and 1991 were $1.209 billion, $824.1
million, and  $756.1 million,  respectively.  During 1993, gross gains of $57.9
million and  gross losses  of $11.0  million were  realized on  such disposals.
During 1992,  gross gains  of $41.0  million and  gross losses of $17.9 million
were realized on such disposals.  During 1991, gross gains of $26.3 million and
gross losses of $15.4 million were realized on such disposals.

     Short term investments are carried at cost, which approximates market
value.



Other Investments

     Real estate  is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or net realizable
value.   Depreciation is  calculated on a straight line basis with useful lives
varying based  on the type of building.  Policy loans and mortgages, other than
those with a decline in value determined to be other than temporary, are stated
at the aggregate of unpaid principal balances.  Other long term investments are
stated at the lower of cost or their estimated net realizable value.

______

(a) Amounts  shown exclude  after-tax capital gains (losses) of $(1.3) million,
$(15.5) million and $5.0 million on a regulatory basis and $7.1 million, $(1.4)
million,  and  $(1.4)  million  on  a  GAAP  basis  in  1993,  1992  and  1991,
respectively.   GAAP income  above also excludes an after-tax charge in 1992 of
$21.5 million  for "cumulative  effect of  accounting change"  relating to  the
adoption of  FASB Statement  No. 106 which had no impact on 1992 regulatory net
income.  Both regulatory and GAAP after-tax income shown above for 1992 reflect
a charge  equivalent to  $10.6  million  on  an  after-tax  basis  relating  to
receivables from  an Association  Group  Health  marketing  organization  which
declared bankruptcy.


     As a  result of  the appropriate  adjustments, Equity  Capital of the life
insurance subsidiaries  prepared in accordance with GAAP exceeds that which was
prepared on  a regulatory  basis by  $826.5 million,  $779.0 million and $736.7
million, respectively, at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.  It should be noted
that the  dividend paying  capability of  the life  insurance  subsidiaries  is
generally limited  by income before capital gains and losses and Equity Capital
as reported  on a  regulatory basis.   Notice  to  or  approval  by  regulatory
authorities is  frequently required  for dividends paid by insurance companies.
Loans to or advances from the life insurance subsidiaries to the parent company
may also  be subject  to regulatory  approval requirements  or limitations.  At
December 31,  1993, the  portion of the aggregate $1.376 billion Equity Capital
of the  life insurance subsidiaries which was not available for transfer to the
parent company  by dividend,  loan, or  advance or  available for such transfer
only with  approval of  a third party ("Restricted Net Assets"), as a result of
the aforementioned  regulatory requirements,  amounted to $1.308 billion.  Cash
dividends paid  by all consolidated subsidiaries to the parent company totalled
$61.2 million, $47.7 million and $58.2 million for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992  and 1991, respectively.  Additionally, during 1993, securities with
market value of $21.6 million were transferred from a life insurance subsidiary
to the  parent company  and subsequently  contributed to another life insurance
subsidiary  in  connection  with  the  combination  of  the  two  subsidiaries'
operations.  In addition to the 1992 cash dividends, investment securities with
market value  of $26.3  million  were  transferred  by  dividend  from  a  life
insurance subsidiary to the parent company.


Life Insurance


  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

     The costs  of acquiring new business (principally commissions) and certain
costs of issuing policies (such as medical examinations and inspection reports)
and certain  agency and  marketing expenses,  all of  which vary  with and  are
primarily related  to the  production of new business, have been deferred.  For
traditional life  insurance policies,  these costs are being amortized over the
premium-paying periods  of the  related policies  in proportion to the ratio of
the  annual   premium  revenue   to  the  total  anticipated  premium  revenue.
Anticipated premium revenue was estimated using the same assumptions which were
used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits.  For universal life-
type policies,  these costs  are being amortized over the lives of the policies
in relation  to  the  incidence  of  gross  profits  arising  principally  from
investment, mortality  and expense  margins.  Deferred policy acquisition costs
are reviewed  to determine that the unamortized portion of such  costs does not
exceed recoverable amounts, after considering anticipated investment income.

     Details with respect to consolidated deferred policy acquisition costs and
premium income  for life  insurance  and  annuities  and  accident  and  health
insurance for the three years ended December 31, 1993 are as follows:

Future Policy Benefits

     Liabilities for  future  policy  benefits  relating  to  traditional  life
insurance policies  have been computed by the net level premium method based on
estimated  future  investment  yield,  mortality  and  termination  experience.
Interest rate  assumptions for  most non-interest sensitive life insurance have
ranged from  2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on issues of 1959 and prior, to 5-1/2 to 5-
7/8 percent  on issues of 1967 and subsequent years.  (On certain products, the
rate ranges  as  high  as  8-3/4  percent.)    Mortality  has  been  calculated
principally on  an experience multiple applied to select and ultimate tables in
common usage  in the  industry.   Estimated terminations  have been  determined
principally based on industry tables.

<PAGE>59



Universal Life-Type and Investment Contracts

     Revenues for  universal  life  insurance,  other  interest-sensitive  life
insurance, and  investment contracts  include policy charges for administration
and cost  of insurance,  and surrender  charges assessed  against  policyholder
account balances  during the  period.   Premiums received on these products are
treated as  policyholder deposits  rather than  revenues.   The  liability  for
policyholder account  balances represents  the accumulated amounts which accrue
to the  benefit of policyholders, and reflects interest credited at rates which
are subject  to periodic  adjustment.   Charges to  expense relating  to  these
policies and  contracts include  such interest  credited as  well  as  benefits
during the period in excess of related policy account balances.


Participating Policies

     Participating policies  subject  to  profit  limitations  approximate  2.4
percent of  the individual life insurance in force at December 31, 1993 and 6.5
percent of individual life insurance premium income in 1993.  The major portion
of earnings  therefrom inures to the benefit of the participating policyholders
and is  not available  to shareholders.    Undistributed  earnings  payable  to
participating policyholders  are included  as a  liability in  the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

     All participating policies approximate 2.5 percent of the total individual
life insurance in force at December 31, 1993 and 6.8 percent of individual life
insurance  premium   income  in   1993.     The  provisions  for  dividends  to
policyholders in  the statements  of consolidated income include dividends paid
or payable on participating policies.


Liability for Unpaid Claims

     The liability  for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is based on
the estimated amount payable on claims reported prior to the balance sheet date
which have  not yet  been settled,  claims reported  subsequent to  the balance
sheet date  which have  been incurred  during the  period then  ended,  and  an
estimate (based on prior experience) of incurred but unreported claims relating
to such period.


Liability for Guaranty Fund Assessments

     The Company's  life insurance  subsidiaries may  be  required,  under  the
solvency or  guaranty laws of the various states in which they are licensed, to
pay assessments  up  to  prescribed  limits  to  fund  policyholder  losses  or
liabilities of  insolvent insurance  companies.   Certain states  permit  these
assessments, or  a portion  thereof, to  be recovered  as an  offset to  future
premium taxes.   Assessments  are recognized based on notification of liability
by regulatory  authorities, including  provision  for  certain  future  amounts
payable, and, when subject to credit against future premium taxes and judged to
be recoverable, may be capitalized and amortized on a basis consistent with the
credits to be realized under applicable state law.


Other Assets

     Included  in   other  assets  is  the  unamortized  portion  of  goodwill,
representing the  excess of  cost over  the value  of net  assets  acquired  in
subsidiary acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method.  Such amounts are
being amortized  by straight-line  basis charges  to  income  over  forty  year
periods which  began at  the respective  dates of  acquisition of  the acquired
subsidiaries.   Amortization of  goodwill amounted  to approximately $2 million
for each of the three years ended December 31, 1993.

<PAGE>60

Income Taxes

     Deferred income  taxes arise as a result of applying enacted statutory tax
rates to  the temporary  differences between  the financial  statement carrying
value and  the tax  basis of  assets and  liabilities.  Such differences result
primarily from  amounts capitalized for policy acquisition costs and calculated
for future policy benefit liabilities.

     The Company  and its  subsidiaries file  a consolidated Federal income tax
return and  have elected  to include  the life insurance and non-life insurance
subsidiaries in  the consolidated  tax  return.    Taxes  on  income  for  life
insurance and  non-life insurance  subsidiaries are  recorded in the individual
income accounts  of the  subsidiaries and  are remitted  to the  Company  on  a
separate  return  basis.    The  provision  for  taxes  in  the  Statements  of
Consolidated Income  for the three years ended December 31, 1993 represents the
tax for all companies on a consolidated return basis.

Income Per Share

     Income per  share was computed by dividing the income applicable to common
and common  equivalent shares  by the  weighted average  number of  common  and
common equivalent  shares outstanding  during each  year.  The weighted average
number of  common and  common equivalent  shares was  determined by  using  the
average number of common shares outstanding during each year, net of reacquired
(treasury) shares from the date of acquisition; by converting the shares of the
Series A and Series B Preferred Stock to their equivalent common shares, and by
calculating the  number of  shares issuable  on exercise  of those common stock
options with  exercise prices  lower than the market price of the common stock,
reduced by  the number  of shares  assumed to  have  been  purchased  with  the
proceeds from  the exercise of the options.  Income before cumulative effect of
accounting  change  and  net  income  were  adjusted  to  deduct  the  dividend
requirements on  Series C  Preferred Stock  for periods  when  that  issue  was
outstanding.   Fully diluted  income per  share is the same as income per share
data indicated.   The following table sets forth the computations of income per
share for the three years ended December 31, 1993:

Statement of Cash Flows

     For the  years ended  December 31,  1993,  1992  and  1991,  respectively,
interest paid  (net of  amounts capitalized)  amounted to  $32.6 million, $34.7
million, and  $39.4 million,  and Federal  income taxes  paid amounted to $60.7
million, $75.7  million and  $71.4 million.  The major portion of the disposals
of fixed  maturity investments  relate to  securities sold or redeemed prior to
their  maturity  dates.    The  $1.154  billion  disposals  of  Fixed  Maturity
investments by  the Company  for the  year ended  December  31,  1993  included
approximately $928  million book  value of  securities which  were  called  for
redemption by  the respective  issuers prior  to maturity.   The  $799  million
disposals of  Fixed Maturity  investments in  1992 included  approximately $497
million of such redemptions.


Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

     The Company's  investments in  Fixed Maturities  and Equity Securities are
comprised of a diverse portfolio represented by approximately 600 issuers, with
no issuer  accounting for  more than  1% of  the Company's  total investment in
these securities, based on book value, at December 31, 1993.

     The Company's  investment in  mortgage  loans  at  December  31,  1993  is
characterized by  a broad  geographical distribution,  with approximately 6% of
total book  value relating  to the New England region of the United States, 16%
from the  middle-Atlantic states,  23% from  the north-central states, 16% from
the south-Atlantic  states, 10%  from the  south-central states,  14% from  the
mountain states,  and 15%  from the  Pacific states.    Based  on  book  value,
approximately 40%  of the  Company's mortgage loans at that date are secured by
office buildings,  24% by  industrial /  warehouse properties,  25% retail,  1%
apartments, 3%  one to  four family  residential, and  the remainder secured by
hotel / motel, medically oriented, or other specialty properties.
<PAGE>62

     The Company's  reinsurance receivables  and other  recoverable amounts  at
December 31,  1993 relate  to approximately  160 reinsurers.   Two major United
States  insurance   companies,  rated   "A"  (excellent)  and  "A+"  (superior)
respectively by  A. M. Best Company, a recognized insurance rating agency, each
account for  approximately 10%  of the  reinsurance receivable  and recoverable
amounts at that date.  Other than these companies, no single reinsurer accounts
for more  than 6%  of total  reinsurance receivable  and recoverable amounts at
December 31,  1993.   The Company  monitors  the  financial  condition  of  its
reinsurers  in   order  to   minimize  its  exposure  to  loss  from  reinsurer
insolvencies.

     As described  in Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements, a life insurance
subsidiary has  an outstanding  standby commitment amounting to $6.8 million at
December 31,  1993.   The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  historically  have  not
provided permanent  financing on the major portion of such commitments.  In the
ordinary course  of investment operations, the Life Insurance Subsidiaries also
may extend  permanent financing  commitments for investments in mortgage loans,
with specified closing dates typically within 90 to 120 days after approval and
interest rates  and other  terms (based  on the  credit policies  utilized  for
investments in  mortgage loans)  determined at the commitment date.  There were
no material permanent financing commitments outstanding at December 31, 1993.


Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of the indicated classes of financial instruments:

Cash and Short-term Investments

     The carrying amounts of these assets approximate their fair value.

Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

     Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes.

Mortgage Loans

     The fair  value of mortgage loans, other than those which are more than 60
days delinquent  or in  foreclosure, is  estimated by  discounting the expected
future cash  flows.   The rates used for this purpose are the estimated current
rates that  would be applied to the loans in a purchase or sale transaction, on
an  aggregate  or  bulk  basis  grouped  by  maturity  range,  considering  the
creditworthiness of  the borrowers  and  the  general  characteristics  of  the
collateral.   For purposes  of this  calculation, the  fair value of loans with
stated interest  rates greater  than the  estimated applicable  market rate was
adjusted to reflect the impact of prepayment options or other contractual terms
upon market  value.   For mortgage  loans which are classified as delinquent or
are in  foreclosure, fair  value is  based on estimated net realizable value of
the underlying collateral.

Long-term Debt

     The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on rates
believed to  be currently  available to  the Company  for borrowings with terms
similar to  the remaining  maturities of the outstanding debt.  For outstanding
debt securities  with fixed  interest rates  in excess of current market rates,
repayment on  call dates  prior to  stated maturity was assumed for purposes of
fair value estimation.

policy loan assets and its policyholder account balance liabilities relating to
investment contracts at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are not materially different
from the respective carrying values at those dates.  No material carrying value
or fair  value amounts  are  ascribed  to  the  Company's  outstanding  standby
commitments at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

Note 2.  Notes Payable

     Included in  this item  are short  term borrowings  against bank  lines of
credit or pursuant to certain bank revolving credit agreements, and other short
term bank  borrowings.  The Company has lines of credit of $60.0 million with 7
banks and  revolving short  term credit agreements with two banks which provide
term loan  borrowing facilities  up to a maximum of $100 million.  The lines of
credit provide  for annual  review and renewal at the option of each bank.  The
interest rates  and terms  of loans under the lines of credit and the revolving
credit  agreements  are  determined  bilaterally  on  the  date  of  borrowing.
Although there  are no  formal requirements  to maintain compensating balances,
the Company has carried balances which generally approximate 5 to 10 percent of
the lines.

     The following  table sets  forth summary information with respect to short
term borrowings of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 1993.

     The Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993, enacted  in August 1993,
increased the  Federal corporate  income tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactively
to January  1, 1993.  This rate increase resulted in additional tax expense for
the first  half of  1993 amounting  to $666 thousand, and the effect of the tax
rate change  upon net  deferred tax  liabilities as  required by  Statement  of
Financial Accounting  Standards No.  109 ("SFAS  109") was  $1.322 million.  In
accordance with  SFAS 109,  the $1.988 million aggregate catch-up impact of the
rate change was included in Federal income tax expense for the third quarter of
1993.

     The significant  components of  deferred income  tax expense for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 are as follows:

     Federal income  tax returns  have been  examined and  settled for all life
insurance subsidiaries  and their  predecessors through 1980.  The consolidated
Federal income  tax returns  of the Company and non-life insurance subsidiaries
have been  examined and  settled through  1980.   The life-nonlife consolidated
Federal income  tax returns  of the  Company and  all  subsidiaries  have  been
examined and  settled for  1981 through  1985.   The Company  believes that its
recorded income tax liabilities are adequate for all open years.

     Under the  provisions of  prior  tax  law  applicable  to  life  insurance
companies, one  half of  the excess  of the  gain from  operations  of  a  life
insurance company  over its taxable investment income was not taxed but was set
aside in  a special  "Policyholders' Surplus Account".  Under provisions of the
Tax Reform Act of 1984, this account is "frozen" as of December 31, 1983 and is
subject  to  tax  under  conditions  set  forth  pursuant  to  prior  tax  law.
Policyholder Surplus  may be  taxable at  the time  of its  distribution to the
company's shareholders  or under  certain  other  specified  conditions.    The
Company does  not believe  that any  significant portion  of the amount in this
account will  be taxed  in the foreseeable future.  However, should the balance
at December 31, 1993 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be
approximately $54.3 million.

     At  December  31,  1993,  the  Company  has  nonlife  net  operating  loss
carryforwards for  Federal income  tax purposes  of approximately $68.5 million
which are  available to  offset future  Federal taxable income, if any, through
2008.


Note 5.  Retirement Plans

     The Company  and its subsidiaries have a qualified noncontributory defined
benefit pension  plan covering  substantially  all  employees.    Benefits  are
generally based  on years  of service,  the employee's  compensation during the
last three  years of employment, and an average of Social Security covered wage
bases.  It is the Company's policy to fund pension costs in accordance with the
requirements of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Based on
such standards,  contributions amounting to $4.5 million, $4.2 million and $3.9
million were  made for  the years  ended December  31,  1993,  1992  and  1991,
respectively.  Substantially all of the Plan assets are invested in the general
investment account  of a  life insurance  subsidiary of  the Company  through a
deposit administration  insurance contract.   As  a result  of compensation and
benefit limitations under Federal tax law applicable to the Company's qualified
defined benefit  pension plan, the "excess" portion of the pension benefits for
certain employees  is provided  under an  unfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan
for which  eligibility requirements  and certain other provisions were modified
during 1993.   Additionally,  the Company  has an  unfunded Retirement Plan for
Outside Directors  which provides pension benefits to non-employee Directors of
USLIFE Corporation subject to specified eligibility requirements.  Benefits are
based on years of service and the annual retainer at time of retirement.

     Pension expense  for all  of the  above pension  plans amounted  to $5.212
million,  $4.774   million  and   $3.748  million   in  1993,  1992  and  1991,
respectively.   The net periodic pension cost for these plans in 1993, 1992 and
1991 included the following components:

In addition  to providing  pension benefits,  the Company  and its subsidiaries
provide certain  health care  and life  insurance benefits to retired employees
under a defined benefit plan.  Employees may become eligible for these benefits
if they  have accumulated  ten years  of service  and  reach  normal  or  early
retirement age  while working for the Company.  The postretirement benefit plan
contains  cost-sharing  features  such  as  deductibles  and  coinsurance,  and
contributions of  certain retirees are subject to annual adjustment.  It is the
Company's current  policy to fund these benefits, which are provided through an
insurance contract  with a  life insurance subsidiary of the Company, on a "pay
as you go" basis.

Effective as  of January  1, 1992,  the Company  adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards   No.  106,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement
Benefits Other  Than Pensions."   Statement No. 106 requires that an employer's
obligation  for   non-pension  plan   benefits  provided  after  retirement  be
recognized by  income statement  charges during the service periods of eligible
employees rather  than on  a cash  basis as permitted by previously established
accounting standards.   The Company elected to recognize the initial obligation
under  the  Statement,  representing  the  present  value  of  future  benefits
attributed to  service already  rendered by eligible employees as of January 1,
1992, by  means of a one-time charge to net income for cumulative effect of the
accounting change.    This  initial  obligation,  and  the  consequent  charge,
amounted to  $57.6 million  before applicable  taxes.   Excluding this one-time
charge,  the   cost  of   non-pension  postretirement  benefits  for  1992  was
approximately $2  million.   Postretirement benefit  costs of  approximately $2
million in 1991, which were recorded on a cash basis, have not been restated.

     During 1993,  the Company's non-pension postretirement benefit program was
modified in  several respects,  including the establishment of a maximum dollar
cap on  amounts to  be paid  by the Company for future increases in the cost of
retiree health  benefits.   These plan  amendments resulted  in an unrecognized
reduction in  prior service  cost, which  is being amortized over the remaining
average  service  period  to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.   Excess gains  or losses  are being  amortized over  the average
remaining service  period to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.

The non-pension  postretirement benefit  cost for  the year  1992 was comprised
primarily of  "interest cost."   For  measurement purposes, a 14 percent annual
rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health benefits (ie., health
care cost  trend rate)  was assumed  for 1993; the rate was assumed to decrease
gradually to  6 percent  by the  year 1997 and remain at that level thereafter.
The assumed  health care  cost trend rate does not have a significant effect on
the amounts  reported in  accordance with  Statement No. 106 due to the maximum
dollar cap adopted.  For example, increasing the assumed health care cost trend
rates by  one percentage  point in  each year  would increase  the  accumulated
postretirement benefit  obligation as of December 31, 1993 by approximately $94
thousand and  the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of 1993
net periodic  postretirement benefit  cost by  $7 thousand.   The discount rate
used in  determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%
at both December 31, 1993 and 1992.

     The outstanding  shares of  Common  Stock  (par  value  $1.00  per  share;
authorized, as  of December  31, 1993: 60,000,000 shares; December 31, 1992 and
1991: 40,000,000  shares; issued, including treasury shares, as of December 31,
1993, 38,308,823  shares; December  31, 1992,  38,255,975 shares;  December 31,
1991, 38,117,150  shares) entitle  each holder  to one  vote per  share in  the
election of  directors and  on  all  other  matters  submitted  to  a  vote  of
shareholders and  to such dividends and distributions as may be declared by the
Board of  Directors out  of funds  legally available.   At  December 31,  1993,
54,948 shares  of Common  Stock were  reserved for  issuance upon conversion of
Preferred Stock.   The  Company sponsors, through certain of its life insurance
subsidiaries, savings  plans for  selected general  agents and  producers  (the
"Agents Plans")  providing for distribution of Common shares to participants if
specified qualification and vesting requirements are satisfied.  As of December
31, 1993,  participant interests  relating to  5,797 Common  shares had  vested
under the  Agents Plans.   On July 10, 1986 the Company issued, to shareholders
of record  on that  date, one  Common Stock Purchase Right (a "Right") for each
share of  Common Stock owned on that date.  Until the Rights become exercisable
they will  be represented  by the stock certificates for all outstanding Common
Stock including  newly issued  shares.   Upon the  occurrence of certain events
specified in  a Rights  Agreement dated  as of  June 24,  1986 and  amended and
restated as  of January  24, 1989 between the Company and Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Company  (predecessor to  Chemical Bank) as Rights Agent, the Rights will
become exercisable,  separate certificates  representing  the  Rights  will  be
issued, and  each Right will entitle the holder to purchase one half of a share
of the  Common Stock  for $50.00.  Under certain circumstances specified in the
Rights Agreement  each Right  will entitle the holder to purchase, for one half
of its then market value, publicly traded common stock of any corporation which
acquires the  Company; each  Right will  also entitle  the holder, with certain
exceptions specified  in the Rights Agreement, to purchase $150.00 worth of the
Common Stock  for $75.00.   As  of December  31, 1993 the Rights had not become
exercisable.
<PAGE>71

     The Company  also sponsors a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
which enables  holders of  the Company's  Common Stock to invest cash dividends
and optional  cash payments in additional shares of the Common Stock.  In 1993,
1992 and  1991, respectively,  25,689, 29,523  and 34,430  shares of the Common
Stock had  been sold  pursuant to  the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan.


     Treasury Stock

     At December 31, 1993, there were 15,650,354 shares of Common Stock held in
treasury.   During 1993,  65,666 Common  shares were  acquired, at an aggregate
cost of $2.6 million, and 168,811 Common shares, with an aggregate cost of $3.2
million, were  utilized for certain employee, director, and agent benefit plans
and  for   the  Dividend   Reinvestment  and  Stock  Purchase  Plan  of  USLIFE
Corporation.   At December  31, 1992,  treasury stock  consisted of  15,753,499
Common shares.


Note 7.  Stock Options, Book Units and Restricted Stock Plan

     In May,  1991, the  Company adopted  a stock  option plan (the "1991 Stock
Option Plan") for key employees to replace the previous stock option plan under
which options  could no longer be granted.  Under the 1991 Stock Option Plan, a
maximum of  1,050,000 shares  of the  Company's common stock may be issued upon
the exercise  of stock  options which may be granted pursuant to the Plan.  The
1991  Stock   Option  Plan  also  provides  for  "Reload"  options,  which  are
automatically granted  to a  participant upon  the exercise of an option if the
participant uses  previously owned shares to pay for the option shares.  Reload
options will  be for  the number  of previously-owned shares delivered upon the
employee's exercise  of an  option.   Under the  1991 Stock  Option  Plan,  the
purchase price  of shares  subject to each option will be not less than 100% of
their fair market value at the time of the grant of the option.  No options may
be granted under the 1991 Stock Option Plan after May 20, 2001.

     No option granted under the Company's stock option plans is exercisable in
whole or  in part  in less than six months from the date of grant.  Each option
may be  exercisable in  one or  more installments  as provided therein.  To the
extent such  options are  not exercised,  installments accumulate  to the total
granted and  are exercisable in whole or in part at any time during the term of
the option.   This  term shall be set forth in the option but in no event is an
option exercisable, in whole or in part, after the expiration of ten years from
the date  of grant.  The 1991 Stock Option Plan provides that in the event of a
Change in  Control (as  defined in  the Plan),  all outstanding options granted
under that  Plan which  have been held for at least six months from the date of
grant shall become immediately exercisable.

     As of  December 31,  1993, the  Company had  outstanding  options  to  its
employees (including  officers) for  purchase of  shares of its Common Stock as
follows:

</TABLE>


     As  of   December  31,  1993,  options  for  530,483  common  shares  were
exercisable under  all stock  option plans  at $18.42  to $29.50 per share.  At
December 31,  1993, up  to 1,585,445  common shares  could be  issued under the
Company's stock  option plans.  Common shares may be issued under the Company's
stock option plans from shares in treasury or authorized but unissued shares.

     In May,  1976 the  Company adopted  a  Book  Unit  Plan  for  certain  key
employees.   Under the  terms of the plan, the Board of Directors may award, at
its sole  discretion, one  or more units to employees it has selected to become
participants in  the plan.   No  more than  600,000 units  shall be outstanding
under the  plan at  any time.  The value of a unit shall be the amount by which
the book value per share, as of its award date, has been increased or decreased
by (a) the sum of the increases or decreases in the book value per share of the
Company's common stock plus (b) dividend equivalents for subsequent years up to
and including  its valuation  date.   Accordingly, approximately  $2.1 million,
$1.4 million, and $1.1 million were charged to expense in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.

</TABLE>

     In May, 1989, the Company adopted a Restricted Stock Plan for certain key
employees.  Under the terms of the Plan, a committee of the Board of Directors
may award restricted shares of common stock of the Company, up to an aggregate
maximum of 1,050,000 shares, to designated Participants.  The shares, when
awarded, are initially non-transferable and subject to forfeiture in the event
that the Participant ceases to be an employee of USLIFE or any of its
subsidiaries other than by reason of death, permanent disability, retirement,
or certain other specified circumstances.  These restrictions generally
terminate with respect to 20% of the number of shares awarded on January 1 of
each of the five calendar years following the year of award, at which time the
appropriate number of unrestricted shares are distributed to the Participant.
For certain awards, restrictions terminate with respect to one-third of the
number of shares awarded on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the
award date, with similar distribution.  Upon award of shares under the Plan,
deferred compensation equivalent to the market value of the shares on the award
date is charged to Equity Capital.  Such deferred compensation is subsequently
amortized by means of charges to expense over the period during which the
restrictions lapse.  During 1993, a total of 18,356 shares were awarded under
the Plan.  During 1991, a total of 16,200 previously awarded shares were
forfeited pursuant to the terms of the plan.  As of December 31, 1993, there
were 30,356 previously awarded shares outstanding under the Plan as to which
<PAGE>73

the restrictions  had not yet lapsed.  Expense charges recognized in 1993, 1992
and 1991  relating to these awards amounted to approximately $2.1 million, $2.0
million, and $2.0 million, respectively.


Note 8.  Leases

     In December,  1986 a  subsidiary of  the  Company  sold  its  home  office
building located  at 125  Maiden Lane,  New York,  New York,  and  leased  back
portions of  the premises  which are  utilized as  the  subsidiary's  principal
executive offices  as well as the headquarters of the Company and several other
subsidiaries.   A $16.9  million portion  of the gain arising from the sale and
leaseback transaction  (net  of  related  taxes)  was  deferred  and  is  being
amortized by  credits to  income in  proportion  to  rental  payments  made  in
accordance with  the lease  commitments over  a ten year period.  Additionally,
several subsidiaries  lease office  space  at  other  locations  generally  for
periods ranging  from five  to fifteen  years, and certain subsidiaries utilize
leased furniture  and office  equipment.   Certain of  the operating leases for
office premises  provide for  renewal options  for periods ranging from five to
twenty years based on fair rental value at time of renewal, and further options
relating to  rental of additional office space.  The minimum rental commitments
for  all   such  non-cancelable  operating  leases  as  of  December  31,  1993
approximate $12.6  million in  1994, $12.4  million in  1995, $11.4  million in
1996, $6.6  million in 1997, $5.5 million in 1998, and a total of $18.4 million
from 1999  to 2003.   Total  rental expense  amounted  to  approximately  $13.5
million, $12.4  million, and  $12.0 million  for the  years ended  December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.



Note 9.  Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

     A  life  insurance  subsidiary  has  an  outstanding  standby  commitment,
representing a contingent obligation to replace certain borrowings in the event
of default by unaffiliated borrowers, amounting to $6.8 million at December 31,
1993. The  life insurance subsidiaries historically have not provided permanent
financing on  the major portion of such commitments.  This commitment, which is
not guaranteed by the parent company, will expire in 1994.

     The Company  has outstanding  Standby Letters  of Credit  with  two  banks
representing contingent  obligations to  fund  various  trusts  established  in
connection with  certain employment  contracts  of  management  employees,  the
Company's Supplemental  Retirement Plan, Retirement Plan for Outside Directors,
and Retirement  Plan, in  the event  of a  Change in Control (as defined in the
trust agreements), totalling $31 million.  Additionally, in connection with the
application by  a life  insurance subsidiary for an additional state license to
transact business, USLIFE Corporation has agreed to guarantee that subsidiary's
maintenance of  the state's minimum capital and surplus requirements (amounting
to $4.4  million at  December 31, 1993) for a ten year period commencing at the
effective date of such license.

     The Company  and certain  of its  subsidiaries are involved in litigation,
which originated  in 1981,  with a former officer of a former subsidiary of the
Company.   Allegations in  the former  officer's lawsuit  include breach of the
covenant of  good faith  and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, infliction
of emotional  distress and  malicious prosecution.   Judgment  was rendered  in
favor of the Company.  That judgment is being appealed.  No contingent loss has
been accrued  for this litigation because the amount of loss, if any, cannot be
reasonably estimated,  nor is it probable in the opinion of management that the
ultimate outcome  of this  litigation will result in a liability to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries.

<PAGE>74

     In April  1991, All  American Life  Insurance Company  ("All American"), a
life insurance  subsidiary of  the Company,  commenced  a  lawsuit  against  11
subscribers to  a reinsurance  pool when  the reinsurers  failed to honor their
obligations under  the reinsurance  agreement.   Certain of the reinsurers also
filed their  own lawsuits against All American.  Approximately $15.8 million of
reinsured claims were in dispute.  All American reached settlements with the 11
reinsurers.  There remain pending against All American certain cross claims for
indemnification  and   contribution  by  a  third  party  administrator  and  a
reinsurance intermediary.  In the opinion of management the ultimate resolution
of this  matter will not result in a material adverse financial impact upon the
Company.

     In March  1992, All  American terminated  the right  of a Managing General
Agent to  sell college  medical insurance on behalf of All American as a result
of the  failure of  the Managing  General Agent  to secure adequate reinsurance
under the  contract and  meet other  contractual obligations.   All American is
currently involved  in litigation  with this former Managing General Agent, who
has declared  bankruptcy, and  All American has taken a charge of $10.6 million
(after applicable taxes) to establish a reserve for amounts receivable from the
Managing General  Agent.    No  contingent  loss  has  been  accrued  for  this
litigation because  the amount of additional loss, if any, cannot be reasonably
estimated, nor  is it  probable in  the opinion of management that the ultimate
outcome of  this litigation will result in a liability to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries.

     In June  1993, a  purported class  action was  filed against  three of the
Company's subsidiaries alleging that the class members were entitled to premium
refunds on  policies of credit life and disability insurance purchased from the
three subsidiaries.   No  contingent loss  has been accrued for this litigation
because the amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

     In addition  to the  aforementioned legal proceedings, the Company and its
subsidiaries are parties to various routine legal proceedings incidental to the
conduct of  their business.   Based on currently available information, in  the
opinion of  management it is not probable that the ultimate resolution of these
suits will result in a material liability on the part of the Company.


Note 10.  Reinsurance

     The life  insurance subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of
the risks they underwrite and assume portions of risks on policies underwritten
by other  companies.   The life insurance subsidiaries generally reinsure risks
over $1.5  million as  well as  selected risks  of lesser  amounts.    In  this
connection, $7.5  billion, representing  6 percent  of total  life insurance in
force as  of December  31, 1993,  was ceded  to other  carriers.    Reinsurance
contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders, and
the Company is contingently liable with respect to insurance ceded in the event
any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations which have been assumed.

The Company's  consolidated financial  statements for 1993 reflect the adoption
of  Statement   of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  113  ("SFAS  113"),
"Accounting and  Reporting for  Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts." Pursuant  to the  standards  of  SFAS  113,  amounts  paid  for  or
recoverable under  reinsurance contracts, including amounts previously reported
as a  reduction of  various liability  accounts  as  permitted  under  previous
accounting standards, are included in total assets as reinsurance receivable or
recoverable  amounts.    The  cost  of  reinsurance  related  to  long-duration
contracts is  accounted for  over the life of the underlying reinsured policies
using assumptions  consistent with  those used  to account  for the  underlying
policies.  Financial statements of previous years were not restated as a result
of the adoption of SFAS 113.

policyholders and beneficiaries, is as follows:

               _______________________________________

   This is  a Third  Amendment ("Third  Amendment") dated as of May 1,
1991 to  an Employment  Agreement ("Agreement")  dated April  1,  1989
between USLIFE  Corporation, a  New York  Corporation ("Employer") and
Wesley E. Forte ("Employee"), which Agreement was first amended on May
1,  1989   by  a  First  Amendment  to  Employment  Agreement  ("First
Amendment"), and which Agreement was further amended on May 1, 1990 by
a Second Amendment to Employment Agreement ("Second Amendment").

   THE TERMS of this Third Amendment are:

   1. Paragraph (2)  of the  Agreement, as  amended by  the First  and
Second Amendments, is now further amended to read, in its entirety, as

of Agreement,  in equal  monthly installments, plus an annual lump sum
bonus payment  of $-0-,  plus such  periodic salary increases and such

Employer's  Board  of  Directors  and/or  the  Executive  Compensation
Committee or  its successor,  in the  sole and  absolute discretion of
said Board  and/or Committee.   Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  be
construed as  precluding merit  increases in  salary or as barring the
Employee from such fringe benefits as the Employer may grant."

   2. Except as  specifically amended  by this  Third  Amendment,  all
other provisions  of the Agreement, as amended by the First and Second
