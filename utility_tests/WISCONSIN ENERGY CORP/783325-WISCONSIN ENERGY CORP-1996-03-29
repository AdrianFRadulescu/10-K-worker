ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("WEC" or the "Company") was incorporated in the
State of Wisconsin in 1981 and became a holding company in 1986.  WEC's
principal subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 were Wisconsin Electric Power
Company ("WE"), an electric and steam utility, and Wisconsin Natural Gas
Company ("WN"), a natural gas utility.  Effective January 1, 1996, WEC merged
WN into WE to form a single combined utility subsidiary.  Where applicable,
references to WE include WN prior to the merger.  Additional information
concerning the merger may be found in Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers" and in Note B - "Mergers" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.  WEC also
has certain non-utility subsidiaries.  The operations of WEC and its
subsidiaries are conducted in four business segments, the primary operations
of which are as follows:

 Business Segment                             Operations
 ----------------                             ----------

Electric Operations             WE generates, transmits, distributes and sells
                                electric energy in a territory of
                                approximately 12,000 square miles with a
                                population estimated at over 2,200,000 in
                                southeastern (including the Milwaukee area),
                                east central and northern Wisconsin and in the
                                Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Gas Operations                  The WE gas operations ("WEGO") purchases,
                                distributes and sells natural gas to retail
                                customers and transports customer-owned gas in
                                three distinct service areas in Wisconsin:
                                west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the
                                Appleton area and the Prairie du Chien area.
                                The gas service territory, which has an
                                estimated population of over 1,100,000, is
                                largely within WE's electric service area.

Steam Operations                WE distributes and sells steam supplied by
                                WE's Valley Power Plant to space heating and
                                processing customers in downtown and near
                                southside areas of Milwaukee.

Non-Utility Operations          For information on non-utility subsidiaries
                                see Item 1. BUSINESS - "NON-UTILITY
                                OPERATIONS."  Non-utility operations were
                                not significant in 1995.

For additional financial information about business segments, see Note L -
"Information by Segments of Business" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in
Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - (cont'd)

MERGER AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN STATES POWER COMPANY ("NSP")

On April 28, 1995, WEC and Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota
corporation ("NSP") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was
amended and restated as of July 26, 1995 ("Merger Agreement").  The Merger
Agreement provides for a strategic business combination involving WEC and NSP
in a "merger-of-equals" transaction ("Transaction").  As a result, WEC will
become a registered public utility holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended ("PUHCA"), and will change its name to
Primergy Corporation ("Primergy").  The headquarters of Primergy will be in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The business of Primergy will consist of owning
utilities and various non-utility subsidiaries.

Primergy will be the parent company of WE (which will be renamed Wisconsin
Energy Company), of NSP (which, for regulatory reasons, will reincorporate in
Wisconsin ("New NSP")), and of the other subsidiaries of WEC and NSP.  In
connection with the Transaction, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin
corporation ("NSP-WI"), currently a utility subsidiary of NSP, will be merged
into Wisconsin Energy Company.  Prior to the merger of NSP-WI into Wisconsin
Energy Company, New NSP will acquire from NSP-WI certain gas utility assets.

Wisconsin Energy Company and New NSP will operate as the principal
subsidiaries of Primergy.  The headquarters of the two utilities will remain
in their current locations, Wisconsin Energy Company's in Milwaukee and New
NSP's in Minneapolis.  Based upon December 31, 1995 statistics, Wisconsin
Energy Company and New NSP will serve a total of approximately 2,350,000
electric customers and 780,000 natural gas customers, and their combined
service territory will include portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota,
South Dakota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors of Primergy will,
upon consummation of the Transaction, consist of twelve directors, divided
into three classes, composed of six persons designated by NSP, including
James J. Howard, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
of NSP, and six persons designated by WEC, including Richard A. Abdoo,
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC.  At the
effective time of the Transaction, Mr. Howard will become Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Primergy, and Mr. Abdoo will become Vice Chairman,
President and Chief Operating Officer of Primergy, pursuant to employment
agreements to be entered into by Messrs. Howard and Abdoo with Primergy, which
will become effective upon consummation of the Transaction.  Pursuant to the
employment agreements, Mr. Howard will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Primergy from and after the effective time of the Transaction until
the later of the date of the annual meeting of the shareholders of Primergy
that occurs in 1998 and the last day of the sixteenth full month following the
effective time of the Transaction, and thereafter will retire as Chief
Executive Officer but will continue to serve as Chairman until the later of
July 1, 2000, or two years after he ceases to be Chief Executive Officer.  Mr.
Abdoo will serve as Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of
Primergy from and after the effective time of the Transaction until Mr. Howard
ceases to be Chief Executive Officer, and thereafter will serve as Vice
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Abdoo will assume the
position of Chairman when Mr. Howard ceases to be Chairman.

Upon receipt of the necessary approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") and on or after the effective time of the Transaction,

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Merger Agreement with NSP - (cont'd)

Wisconsin Energy Company and New NSP will become parties to an Interchange
Agreement, whereby costs of generating capacity and transmission are shared in
a manner similar to an existing interchange agreement between NSP and NSP-WI. 
The integration of the Wisconsin Energy Company and New NSP generating
capacity should increase the ability of these companies to meet demands for
electricity within the service territories each serves.  It is also
anticipated that a single administrative and support system will be
established following the Transaction.

The non-utility operations of WEC are presently conducted through six active
wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The non-utility operations of NSP are conducted
primarily through NRG Energy, Inc., Cenergy, Inc. and Eloigne Company. 
Following the Transaction, it is anticipated that New NSP will transfer its
non-utility businesses to Primergy and that such non-utility businesses of New
NSP, along with the non-utility businesses of WEC, will be conducted through
one or more subsidiaries of Primergy that are not subsidiaries of Wisconsin
Energy Company or New NSP.

WEC is currently exempt from the registration and other requirements of PUHCA,
other than from Section 9(a)(2) thereof, pursuant to an order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  SEC approval under PUHCA is
required in connection with the Transaction.

The PUHCA exemption under which WEC currently operates will not be available
to Primergy after consummation of the Transaction.  Accordingly, upon
consummation of the Transaction, Primergy must register as a holding company. 
PUHCA imposes numerous restrictions on the operations of a registered holding
company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  Subject to limited exceptions,
SEC approval is required under PUHCA for a registered holding company or any
of its subsidiaries to: (i) issue securities, (ii) acquire utility assets from
a third person, (iii) acquire the stock of another public utility, (iv) amend
its articles of incorporation or (v) acquire stock, extend credit, pay
dividends, lend money or invest in any manner in any other businesses.  SEC
approval under PUHCA also will be required for certain proposed transactions
relating to the Transaction.  As part of the SEC approval process, PUHCA also
limits the ability of registered holding companies to engage in non-utility
ventures and regulates holding company system service companies and the
rendering of services by holding company affiliates to the system's utilities.

The SEC may require, as a condition to its approval of the Transaction, that
WEC and NSP divest their gas utility properties and possibly certain non-
utility ventures within a reasonable time after the Transaction is
consummated.  In a few cases, the SEC has allowed the retention of such
properties or deferred the question of divestiture for a substantial period of
time.  In those cases in which divestiture has taken place, the SEC has
usually allowed enough time to complete the divestiture so as to allow the
applicant to avoid a "fire sale" of the divested assets.  WEC and NSP believe
strong policy reasons and prior SEC decisions exist which support their
retaining their existing gas utility properties and non-utility ventures, or,
alternatively, which support deferring the question of divestiture for a
substantial period of time.  Accordingly, WEC and NSP will request in their
merger application with the SEC that WEC and NSP be allowed to retain, or in
the alternative, that the question of divestiture be deferred with respect to,
WEC's and NSP's existing gas utility properties and non-utility ventures.

Also, regulatory authorities may require the restructuring of transmission
system operations or administration.  WEC currently cannot determine if such 

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE> 7
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Merger Agreement with NSP - (cont'd)

restructuring will be required.  In addition, Wisconsin State law limits the
total assets of non-utility affiliates of Primergy, which could affect the
amount of non-utility operations.  See Item 1. BUSINESS - "NON-UTILITY
OPERATIONS" below.

Subject to the qualifications expressed below, WEC and NSP believe that
synergies from the Transaction will generate substantial cost savings to
Primergy, which would not be available absent the Transaction.  Preliminary
estimates by the managements of WEC and NSP indicate that the Transaction
could result in potential net cost savings (that is, after taking into account
the costs incurred to achieve such savings) of approximately $2 billion during
the ten-year period from 1997 through 2006 assuming that the Transaction is
consummated at the beginning of 1997.  Achieved savings in costs are expected
to inure to the benefit of both shareholders and customers.  The treatment of
the benefits and cost savings will depend on the results of regulatory
proceedings in the various jurisdictions in which WEC and NSP operate their
businesses.

The analyses employed in order to develop estimates of potential savings as a
result of the Transaction were necessarily based upon various assumptions that
involve judgements with respect to, among other things, future national and
regional economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, regulatory
treatment, weather conditions, financial market conditions, future business
decisions and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond the control of WEC and NSP.  Accordingly, while WEC
and NSP believe that such assumptions are reasonable for purposes of the
development of estimates of potential savings, there can be no assurance that
such assumptions will approximate actual experience or that such savings will
be realized.  The parties have proposed certain utility rate reductions and
rate freezes in connection with the Transaction.  See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -
"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Mergers."

On September 13, 1995, the stockholders of WEC and NSP voted to approve the
merger.  The Merger Agreement is subject to various conditions including
approval by all applicable regulatory authorities.  Subject to obtaining all
requisite approvals, WEC and NSP anticipate completing the Transaction by
January 1, 1997.

The future operations and financial position of WEC will be significantly
affected by the Transaction.  Unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information for Primergy at December 31, 1995 and for the twelve months then
ended is included in this report following Item 14. EXHIBITS, FINANCIAL
STATEMENT SCHEDULES, AND REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.  Additional information may be
found in Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER

OPERATIONS - Mergers" and in Note B - "Mergers" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Electric energy sales by WE in 1995, to all classes of customers, totaled
approximately 27.3 billion kilowatt-hours, a 1.4% increase over 1994.  On
July 31, 1995, WE reached a new all-time electric peak demand of 5,368
megawatts during a period of unusually hot and humid weather.  The previous
record peak demand prior to the summer of 1995 of 4,950 megawatts was set on
June 14, 1994.  Electric energy sales are impacted by seasonal factors and
varying weather conditions from year-to-year.

<PAGE> 8
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Electric Utility Operations - (cont'd)

There were 955,616 electric customers at December 31, 1995, an increase of
1.1% since December 31, 1994.  For further information by customer class, see
"Electric Revenues, Kilowatt-Hour Sales and Customer Statistics" in Item 6.
SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

In 1995, WE's net generation amounted to approximately 26.7 billion kilowatt-
hours.  Generation was supplemented with approximately 2.3 billion kilowatt-
hours purchased from neighboring utilities and, to a minor extent, from other
sources.  The dependable capability of WE's generating stations was 5,619
megawatts in August 1995 as more fully described in Item 2. PROPERTIES.

Paris Generating Station:  During 1995, WE placed in service four units of
approximately 300 megawatts of capacity at its Paris Generating Station
("Paris").  This natural gas-fired combustion turbine facility, located near
Union Grove, Wisconsin, is designed to meet peak demand requirements.  Capital
costs of the Paris facility will total approximately $105 million.  For
additional information, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES - Investing Activities."

The supply of natural gas to operate Paris and WE's Concord Generating Station
("Concord"), a natural gas-fired combustion turbine facility located near
Watertown, Wisconsin, is delivered by the WEGO.  See Item 1. BUSINESS -
"SOURCES OF GENERATION - Natural Gas (for Electric Generation)" below.

LS Power Generation Facility:  In accordance with a PSCW order issued in
November 1993, after completing a capacity-related competitive bidding
process, WE signed a long-term agreement to purchase the electricity that
would be generated from a 215 megawatt cogeneration facility planned to be
constructed by an unaffiliated independent power producer ("IPP"), LSP-
Whitewater L.P. ("LS Power").  The agreement is contingent upon the facility
being completed and going into operation, which at this time is planned for
mid-1997.  For additional information, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000."

PSCW Advance Plan 7:  In January 1994, WE filed with the PSCW its long-term
load and supply plan as part of the Advance Plan 7 Docket.  In the Advance
Plan process, the regulated electric utilities located in Wisconsin file, for
planning purposes, long-term forecasts of future resource requirements along
with plans to meet those requirements, including the planned implementation of
energy management and conservation programs ("demand-side savings").  In
addition to specifying the expectations of conservation and load management
programs, the plan filed with the PSCW indicated a need for additional peaking
and intermediate load capacity during the 20-year planning period.  WE does
not anticipate needing additional base load generation until after 2010.  The 
PSCW approved WE's Advance Plan 7 in December 1995.  For additional
information regarding Advance Plans, see Item 1. BUSINESS - "REGULATION" below
and Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital
Requirements 1996-2000."

In Advance Plan 7, WE estimated peak demand in the year 2005 to be about 5,270
megawatts excluding the requirements of the Wisconsin Public Power, Inc.
System ("WPPI"), WE's largest municipal power agency customer.  This estimate
assumes, among other factors, moderate growth in the economy and normal
weather.  This estimate does not, however, reflect any potential modifications

                                     - 8 -
<PAGE> 9
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Electric Utility Operations - (cont'd)

to the current regulatory environment.  Investments in demand-side management
("DSM") programs have reduced and delayed the need to add new generating
capacity but have not eliminated the need entirely.  Purchases of power from
other utilities and transmission system upgrades will also combine to help
delay the need to install some new generating capacity in the future.  WE
plans to make continued expenditures for conservation-related programs during
this period.  For additional information about WPPI, see Item 1. BUSINESS -
"Sales to Wholesale Customers" below.

The addition of new generating units requires approval of the PSCW following a
two-stage bidding process, which could influence whether WE would construct
such facilities or purchase the required power.  The United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources ("DNR") also must approve new generating units.  All
proposed generating facilities will meet or exceed the applicable federal and
state environmental requirements.  For further information regarding future
capacity additions, see Item 1. BUSINESS - "REGULATION" below.

For information regarding estimated costs of WE's construction program for the
five years ending December 31, 2000, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000."  All estimates of
construction expenditures exclude Allowance For Funds Used During
Construction.  For additional information regarding matters related to
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction, see Note E - "Allowance for
Funds Used During Construction" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Milwaukee County Power Plant:  In December 1995, WE signed an agreement with
Milwaukee County to purchase the Milwaukee County Power Plant located in
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  The 11 megawatt power plant provides steam, chilled
water and electricity for the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and several
other large customers located on the Milwaukee County grounds.  WE had
previously obtained approval from the PSCW for the purchase of the electric
generation and distribution facilities and acquired them in December 1995 with
a capital expenditure of $7 million.  As part of the agreement, WE will also
acquire in 1996 the steam facilities and a non-utility affiliate of WEC will
acquire the chilled water facilities from Milwaukee County.  Purchase of the
steam and chilled water portions of the plant is contingent upon PSCW approval
to acquire the steam facilities and upon the five major customers signing ten-
year steam and chilled water service agreements.  See Item 1. BUSINESS -
"STEAM UTILITY OPERATIONS" and "NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS" below as well as Item
7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-
2000."

PSCW Electric Utility Investigation:  The PSCW has conducted an investigation
into the state of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin, particularly its
institutional structure and regulatory regime, in order to evaluate what
changes would be beneficial for Wisconsin.  The PSCW stated that this
investigation may result in profound and fundamental changes to the nature and
regulation of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin.  For additional
information and related matters, see Item 1. BUSINESS - "REGULATION" below and
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

Wisconsin Electric Revitalization:  In response to increasing competitive
pressures in the markets for electricity and natural gas, WE implemented a
revitalization process to increase efficiencies and improve customer service
by reengineering and restructuring the organization.  The new structures
consolidated many business functions and simplified work processes.  Due to
productivity improvements from the Revitalization program, staffing levels at
WE have been reduced during 1994 and 1995; 403 employees retired under an
early retirement option and 726 employees enrolled in severance packages.  See
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Wisconsin Electric
Revitalization" and Note K - "Benefits Other Than Pensions" in the NOTES TO

Coal

WE diversifies its coal sources by purchasing from Northern Appalachia, the
Southern Powder River Basin (Wyoming) and the Raton Basin (New Mexico) mining
districts for the power plants in Wisconsin, and from the Uinta Region
(Colorado), central Appalachia and western mines for the Presque Isle Power
Plant in Michigan.

<PAGE> 11
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

Approximately 75%  of WE's 1996 coal requirements are expected to be delivered
by WE-owned unit trains.  The unit trains will transport coal for the Oak
Creek and Pleasant Prairie Power Plants from Pennsylvania, New Mexico and
Wyoming mines.  Coal from Pennsylvania mines is also transported via rail to
Lake Erie transfer docks and delivered to the Valley and Port Washington Power
Plants by lake vessels.  Montana coal for Presque Isle is transported via rail
to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into lake vessels
for plant delivery.  The Presque Isle central Appalachian origin and Colorado
origin coal is shipped via rail to Lake Erie and Lake Michigan (Chicago) coal
transfer docks, respectively, for lake vessel delivery to the plant.  WE's
1996 coal requirements, projected to be 10.0 million tons, are 97% under
contract.  WE does not anticipate any problem in procuring its remaining 1996
requirements through short-term or spot purchases and inventory adjustments.

Pleasant Prairie Power Plant:  All of the estimated 1996 coal requirements at
this plant are presently covered by three long-term contracts.  

Oak Creek Power Plant:  All of the estimated 1996 coal requirements for this
plant are covered by one long-term contract and two short-term contracts.  A
significant coal cost decrease is anticipated with the blending of lower cost
Wyoming sub-bituminous coal with bituminous coals.

Presque Isle Power Plant:  This plant has six generating units designed to
burn bituminous coal and three other units designed to burn sub-bituminous
coal.  The units burning sub-bituminous coal are supplied by one long-term
contract and two medium-term contracts, the annual volumes of which are
anticipated to be adequate to cover coal requirements through 1996. 
Bituminous coal is generally purchased through one-year contracts from central
Appalachia and under a five-year contract for the Colorado origin coal.

Edgewater 5 Generating Unit:  Coal for this unit, in which WE has a 25%
interest, is purchased by Wisconsin Power and Light Company, a non-affiliated
utility, which is the majority owner of the facility.

Valley and Port Washington Power Plants:  These plants are both supplied
through a long-term contract that, in combination with coal supplied to WE's
other Wisconsin plants, allows the plants to meet the requirements of the
Wisconsin acid rain law.  In the event of further air quality emission
requirements affecting these plants, the contract can be terminated without
liability.

Nuclear

WE purchases uranium concentrates ("yellowcake") and contracts for its
conversion, enrichment and fabrication.  WE maintains title to the nuclear
fuel until the fabricated fuel assemblies are delivered to the Point Beach
Nuclear Plant ("Point Beach"), whereupon it is sold to and leased back from
the Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust ("Trust").  See Note F - "Nuclear
Operations" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Uranium Requirements:  WE requires approximately 450,000 pounds of yellowcake
annually for its two units at Point Beach.  Uranium requirements through 1997
will be provided from a combination of existing contracts with Malapai
Resources Company (of Arizona); Energy Resources of Australia, Ltd.; and Nukem
Inc. (U.S.).  WE may exercise flexibilities in these contracts and purchase
certain quantities of uranium on the spot-market, should market conditions
prove favorable.  WE believes that adequate supplies of uranium concentrates
will be available to satisfy current and future operating requirements.

Under a contract with Nuexco Trading Corporation, WE was to receive 200,000
pounds of uranium concentrates on specified delivery dates in 1995 at
conversion facilities in the United States or Canada in exchange for the
transfer to Nuexco of an identical quantity of concentrates held by WE at the
conversion facilities of Comurhex in France.  However, Nuexco is in default
under the contract and has filed for bankruptcy law protection.  Upon
completion of review of various options available for use of the concentrates
located at Comurhex, WE decided to sell this material.  A sales contract was
executed between WE and a uranium broker in December 1995.

Conversion:  WE has a conversion contract with the Cameco Corporation, to
provide for up to 100 percent of conversion requirements for the Point Beach
reactors from 1996 through 1999.  Cameco is a Canadian based corporation
located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and is a major producer of uranium
concentrates.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

Enrichment:  WE currently has a Utility Services Contract with the United
States Department of Energy ("DOE") for 70% of the enrichment services
required for the operation of both of the Point Beach units.  The contract can
provide enrichment services for the entire operating life of each unit.  For a
discussion of litigation involving the Utility Services Contract, see Item 3. 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - "OTHER LITIGATION - Uranium Enrichment Charges". 
Responsibility for administering this contract and for enrichment services was
transferred from the DOE to U.S. Enrichment Corporation ("USEC") under the
Energy Policy Act of 1992.  In March 1992, WE entered into an agreement with
Global Nuclear Services and Supply Limited, an international supplier of
enrichment services, for the remaining 30% of enrichment service requirements.

Fabrication:  Fabrication of fuel assemblies from enriched uranium for Point
Beach is covered under a contract with Westinghouse Electric Corporation for
the balance of the plant's current operating license.  During 1995, an
agreement was reached between WE and Westinghouse to supply WE with a new fuel
design beginning in the fall 1997.  The new fuel design is expected to provide
additional safety margin, cost savings and reduce the number of discharged
spent fuel assemblies over the remaining operating license.

Spent Fuel Storage and Disposal:  WE currently has the capability to store
certain amounts of spent nuclear fuel at Point Beach.  Previous modifications
to the storage facilities at Point Beach had made it possible to accommodate
all spent fuel expected to be discharged from the reactors through 1995 while
maintaining the capability for one full core off-load.  In accordance with the
provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which requires the DOE to
provide for the disposal of spent fuel from all U.S. nuclear plants, WE
entered into a disposal contract providing for deliveries of spent fuel to the
DOE for ultimate disposal commencing in January 1998.  It is anticipated that
the DOE will be unable to accept spent fuel by the 1998 timeframe as
contracted.

In November of 1991, WE filed an application with the PSCW for authority to
construct and operate an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation
("ISFSI").  The ISFSI provides interim dry cask storage until the DOE begins
to remove spent fuel from Point Beach in 1998 in accordance with the terms of
the contract it has with WE.  Public hearings on the proposed project were
held during October 1994.  On February 13, 1995, WE received a Certificate of
Authority from the PSCW to construct and operate the ISFSI for 12 storage
casks, which will handle the storage requirements until 1998.  Should the DOE
be unable to begin taking ownership of and removing the spent fuel in 1998, WE
will need to construct additional casks and will seek PSCW approval to do so. 
Construction of the ISFSI was completed in June 1995 and the first cask,
containing 24 spent fuel assemblies, was loaded and moved to the ISFSI during
December 1995.  Transfer of additional spent fuel to the ISFSI has been
temporarily suspended by WE pending further action by the PSCW as described
below.

In March 1995 separate petitions were filed by intervenors in Dane County
Circuit Court and Fond du Lac County Circuit Court.  The two petitions were
ultimately combined into one petition in Dane County Circuit Court ("Court"). 
The Dane County petition sought reversal of the order and a remand to the PSCW
directing it to deny WE's request for authorization to construct the dry cask
facility, or in the alternative, to correct the alleged errors in the PSCW's
order.  On December 22, 1995, the Court issued a decision vacating and

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

remanding the February 1995 order of the PSCW, stating that the Environmental
Impact Statement prepared by the PSCW for this project was inadequate in two
respects.  First, it did not adequately analyze the environmental impacts from
storage of spent fuel for a sufficient duration; second, it did not
sufficiently evaluate the alternative of employing a combination of renewable
energy sources and conservation in lieu of continued operation of Point Beach
beyond 1998.  The Court also held that the PSCW failed to make the findings of
fact and conclusions of law, based on the record, demonstrating that it
properly considered the priorities of conservation, renewable and other energy
sources over nuclear sources to the extent cost effective, technically
feasible and environmentally sound.  The PSCW issued two Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statements which address the deficiencies found by the
Court and held related hearings in February and March 1996.  See Item 1.
BUSINESS - "SOURCES OF GENERATION - Point Beach Unit 2 Steam Generators" below
for related discussion and cross-references to additional information in this
report.

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:  Point Beach provided 26.9% of WE's net generation
in 1995.  The plant has two generating units which had a combined dependable
capability of 973 megawatts in August 1995 and which together constituted
17.3% of WE's dependable generating capability.  As a result of degradation of
some of the tubes within the Unit 2 steam generators, the power level of Unit
2 has been administratively reduced by 10% to provide operating reliability
until the steam generators can be replaced, which is expected to occur in the
fall of 1996.  See Item 1. BUSINESS - "SOURCES OF GENERATION - Point Beach
Unit 2 Steam Generators" below.  The United States Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ("NRC") licenses for Point Beach Units 1 and 2 expire October 5,
2010 and March 8, 2013, respectively.

The NRC has, at various times, directed that certain inspections,
modifications and changes in operating practices be made at all nuclear
plants.  At Point Beach, such inspections have been made and necessary changes
to equipment and in operating practices have either been completed or are
expected to be completed within the time schedules permitted by the NRC or
within approved extensions thereof.  Good performance of Point Beach was
recognized by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations ("INPO") with the
awarding of an INPO 1 rating to Point Beach in November 1995.

WE has initiated certain plant betterment projects at Point Beach that are
judged to be appropriate and beneficial.  Construction is progressing on the
addition of two safety-related emergency diesel powered electrical generators
with installation to be completed in 1996.  

Point Beach Unit 2 Steam Generators:  On October 1, 1992, WE filed an
application with the PSCW for the replacement of the Unit 2 steam generators,
which would allow for the unit's operation until the expiration of its
operating license in 2013.  This project is estimated to cost $96 million. 
(In 1984 WE replaced the Unit 1 steam generators.)  In an Interim Order dated
February 13, 1995, the PSCW deferred the decision on the steam generator
replacements until after the refueling outage in September 1995.  The PSCW
directed WE to make suitable arrangements with the fabricator of the new steam
generators to allow the fabrication, delivery and replacement to proceed
promptly if authorized by the PSCW as a result of further investigation.  The
reasonable costs of such arrangements to maintain a place in line with the
fabricator will be afforded rate recovery.  Work on the Unit 2 replacement
steam generators has continued such that delivery in July of 1996 can occur in

order to meet the schedule requirements for a fall 1996 replacement.  In early
February 1996, the PSCW conducted hearings on a Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement concerning the Unit 2 steam generator replacement and the
need for such replacement taking into account the information gained from
inspections conducted during the fall 1995 refueling and maintenance outage.
 
WE anticipates that the PSCW will issue a combined final order on replacement
of the Unit 2 steam generators and the remanded dry cask storage matters
discussed above in May 1996.  Failure by the PSCW to approve the steam
generator replacements and resolve the remanded issues could jeopardize the
continued operation of Point Beach and materially affect WE's financial
position and results of operations due to the need to replace the lost
generating capacity.  WE would likely seek regulatory relief to minimize such
impact.  For additional information, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000" and Note F - "Nuclear
Operations" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Decommissioning Fund:  Pursuant to a 1985 PSCW order, amended in 1994, WE
provides for costs associated with the eventual decommissioning of Point Beach
through the use of an external trust fund.  Payments to this fund, together
with investment earnings, brought the balance in the trust fund on 
December 31, 1995 to approximately $275 million.  For additional information
regarding decommissioning see Note F - "Nuclear Operations" in the NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Nuclear Plant Insurance:  For information regarding matters pertaining to
nuclear plant insurance, see Note F - "Nuclear Operations" in the NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Hydroelectric

WE has various licenses from the FERC for its hydroelectric generating
facilities that expire during the period 1998 to 2004.  In February 1996, WE
filed a final application for its largest hydro facility, Big Quinnesec Falls,
which has a license expiring in 1998.  During 1995, FERC issued 30 and 40 year
licenses to the Pine and Brule Hydroelectric projects, respectively.  The
Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the White Rapids and Chalk Hill
Hydroelectric Projects was published by FERC in November 1995.  These two
projects continue to operate under annual licenses.  The three hydro
facilities, Oconto Falls, Sturgeon and Weyauwega, with a total of 2.5
megawatts installed capacity, that WE decided not to relicense in 1993 are
still being operated by WE under annual licenses until FERC determines their
disposition.  WE continues to consult with the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, DNR, Michigan Department of Natural Resources ("MDNR"; now the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ")) and the National Park
Service in conjunction with the licensing process.  Hydroelectric facilities
provided approximately 1.6% of WE's total energy generation in 1995.

Natural Gas (for Electric Generation)

Concord, Paris and the Oak Creek combustion turbine use natural gas as their
primary fuel, with Number 2 fuel oil as backup.  Natural gas for Concord and
the Oak Creek gas turbines is purchased directly from the WEGO at tariff
rates.  Gas for Paris is purchased on the spot market - from gas marketers
and/or producers - and delivered on the WEGO local distribution system. 

                                    - 15 -
<PAGE> 16
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

A balancing and storage agreement with ANR Pipeline facilitates the variable
gas usage pattern of Paris.

Natural gas for boiler ignition and flame stabilization purposes for the
Pleasant Prairie, Oak Creek, and Valley Power Plants is purchased under an
agency agreement with a gas marketing company.  The agent purchases natural
gas and arranges for interstate pipeline transportation to the local gas
distribution utility.  The local gas distribution utilities then transport
WE's gas to each plant under interruptible tariffs.  WEGO is the distribution
utility for Pleasant Prairie and Oak Creek.  Wisconsin Gas Company, a non-
affiliated company, is the distribution utility for the Valley Power Plant.

Oil

Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at Point Beach, Germantown and
Port Washington Power Plants.  It is also used for boiler ignition and flame
stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant and as backup for ignition for
Pleasant Prairie and as a backup fuel for the natural gas fired gas turbines,
as discussed above.  Fuel oil requirements are purchased under partnering
agreements with suppliers that assist WE with inventory tracking and oil
market price trends.

Interconnections with Other Utilities

WE's system is interconnected at various locations with the systems of Madison
Gas and Electric Company, Wisconsin Power and Light Company, Wisconsin Public
Service Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Company ("Commonwealth Edison"), NSP
and Upper Peninsula Power Company ("UPPCO").  These interconnections provide
for interchange of power to assure system reliability as well as facilitating
access to generating capacity and the transfer of energy for economic
purposes.

WE is a member of Wisconsin-Upper Michigan Systems ("WUMS"), a coordinating
group which includes four other electric companies in Wisconsin and Upper
Michigan.  WUMS, in turn, is a member of Mid-America Interconnected Network
("MAIN"), which is one of nine regional members of the North American Electric
Reliability Council.  Membership in these groups permits better utilization of
reserve generating capacity and coordination of long-range system planning and
day-to-day operations.

In March 1994, WE executed a transmission service agreement with Commonwealth
Edison that allows WE to purchase energy from southern Illinois and Indiana
suppliers, using the Commonwealth Edison transmission system to import such
energy into Wisconsin.  

A transmission service agreement has been executed to allow WE to reserve
capacity and import energy from members of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool
("MAPP"), a group consisting of electric utilities generally located west of
Wisconsin including NSP.  Considerable non-firm energy is expected to be
purchased from MAPP members over the next several years.

In February 1996, WE and five other Midwest utilities announced that they had
agreed to pursue the development of an independent organization, the Midwest
Independent System Operator ("ISO"), which would be responsible for ensuring
nondiscriminatory open transmission access and the planning and security of
the combined bulk transmission systems of the utilities.  In addition to WE,
the utilities signing a memorandum of understanding are American Electric 

                                    - 16 -
<PAGE> 17
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

Power Co., Centerior Energy Corp., Cinergy Corp., Detroit Edison Co. and
Northern Indiana Public Service Company.  The other transmission owners of the
East Central Area Reliability Council ("ECAR") and MAIN will be invited to
participate in the development of the Midwest ISO.  Plans for the Midwest ISO
are expected to be filed with the FERC in late 1996 and would be implemented
in stages after approval.

Sales to Wholesale Customers

WE currently provides wholesale electric energy to five municipally owned
systems, three rural cooperatives, two municipal joint action agencies and one
isolated system of an investor-owned utility in Wisconsin, Illinois, and the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan under rates approved by the FERC.  Sales to these
wholesale customers accounted for 5.0% of total kilowatt-hour sales in 1995. 
Under two agreements, service is being provided subject to a seven-year notice
of cancellation from WPPI.  WE also has an eight-year power supply agreement
with the Badger Power Marketing Authority ("BPMA").  Sales to the BPMA and
WPPI combined are expected to account for approximately one half of the
wholesale sales for 1996.

Service to UPPCO, under a 65 megawatt agreement which expires on 
December 31, 1997, accounted for 20% of 1995 wholesale sales.  In October
1993, UPPCO announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with NSP
to purchase up to 90 megawatts of base-load electric energy beginning in 1998. 
WE expects to apply the 65 megawatts of capacity toward the electric energy
needs of new customers and toward the overall increase in system supply needs
anticipated by 1998.  

During 1995, sales to wholesale customers declined 5.6% from 1994, largely the
result of reductions in sales to WPPI.  WPPI has been reducing its purchases
from WE subsequent to acquiring generation capacity in 1990.  Sales to WPPI
during 1993, 1994 and 1995 were approximately 944,000 megawatt-hours ("Mwh"),
725,000 Mwh and 627,000 Mwh, respectively.  Further reductions are expected as
WPPI installs additional capacity.  These sales reductions are not expected to
have a significant effect on future earnings.  Under the provisions of a long-
term agreement, WE will continue to provide transmission services to WPPI.

WE's existing FERC tariffs also provide for transmission service to its
wholesale customers.  During 1995, WE had nine customers taking transmission
service.  For further information see Item 1.  BUSINESS - "REGULATION" below.

In October 1992, the Energy Policy Act was signed into law.  Passage of this
law has removed encumbrances and facilitates the entry of power producers and
power marketers into the already competitive bulk power market.  Notable among
its provisions are the creation of a new class of energy producer called
Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWGs"), who are exempt from the requirements of
PUHCA, and the rights that the Energy Policy Act provides them and utilities
to request a FERC order directing the provision of transmission service if
denied transmission access from utilities.  The transmission aspects of this
law are expected to have little impact on WE since it has had open access
transmission tariffs on file with the FERC since 1980.

During 1995, WE reached agreement on new contracts of five or ten years in
length with four wholesale customers accounting for a total of 61.4 MW.  Each
contract contained substantial discounts from previous rates.  UPPCO, a fifth
8 MW wholesale customer, opted to obtain power supplies from another utility
for its Iron River System.  Two other wholesale customers, accounting for a 

                                    - 17 -
<PAGE> 18
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Sources of Generation - (cont'd)

total of 18 MW, have not yet made decisions on their choice of power supply. 
WE is actively pursuing wholesale customers who are currently supplied by
other utilities.

In December 1995, WEC and NSP entered into a settlement agreement with certain
municipal Wisconsin intervenors that ended the latters' participation in the
FERC and state merger proceedings with respect to the Transaction.  The
settlement agreement, which provides for certain rate reductions on power
sales and transmission services, is pending FERC action.  See Item 1. BUSINESS
- - "MERGER AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN STATES POWER COMPANY" above for additional
information about the Merger Agreement with NSP.

The electric utility industry continues to become increasingly competitive. 
Some municipal utilities are approaching competing utilities in a search for
lower energy prices.  Additionally, some large industrial customers are
seeking regulatory changes that could permit retail wheeling to allow them to
seek proposals for energy from alternate suppliers.  IPPs are also exploring
cogeneration projects which would provide process steam to customers in WE's
service territory and sell electricity to WE.  Consequently, electric
wholesale and large retail customers of WE or other non-affiliated utilities
may determine, from time to time, to switch energy suppliers, purchase
interests in existing power plants or build new generating capacity, either
directly or through joint ventures with third parties.  The advent of EWGs can
be expected to accelerate this practice.  For additional information, see Item
7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-
2000."


GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Effective January 1, 1996, WEC merged its natural gas utility subsidiary,
Wisconsin Natural Gas Company ("WN"), into WE to form a single combined
utility subsidiary.  In 1995, WE and WN obtained approval of the merger by the
PSCW as well as consent of the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") for
WE to assume WN's liabilities.  The merger, approved by the stockholders of WE
in December 1994, is expected to improve customer service and reduce future
operating costs.  Where applicable, references to WE include WN prior to the
merger.

Effective January 1, 1994, Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc. ("WSG") was
acquired by WEC through a statutory merger of WSG into WN.  WE continues to
use the acquired facilities of WSG for the distribution and transportation of
natural gas.  For additional information, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers."

Total gas therms delivered by WE, including customer-owned gas transported,
increased 9.3% in 1995 compared to 1994, reflecting primarily colder winter
weather during 1995, which increased heating load, and warmer summer weather
during 1995, which increased deliveries to electric peak generation stations.

During 1995, approximately 6% of total deliveries were on interruptible rates. 
WE's maximum daily send-out in 1995 was 630,823 Dths.  A dekatherm ("Dth") is
equivalent to ten therms or one million British Thermal Units ("BTU").  Sales
of gas fluctuate with the heating cycle of the year and are also impacted by
varying weather conditions from year-to-year.

                                    - 18 -
<PAGE> 19
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Gas Utility Operations - (cont'd)

The WEGO has entered into more than 45 gas service contracts for supply,
pipeline capacity, underground storage and balancing services.  Contracts vary
in term from less than one year to ten years.  Gas supply contracts contain
pricing options that allow pricing at market rates or the ability to fix
future prices for varying terms which the WEGO can exercise to manage the risk
of substantial market price fluctuations.  The gas from these contracts is
used to meet customer requirements on a daily basis and to fill storage during
the warm months to be withdrawn from storage during the heating season in
order to meet system gas demands.

The use of storage increases the load factor of supply contracts and allows
the WEGO to take advantage of seasonal price differentials.  The WEGO has
eight firm gas storage agreements that allow daily withdrawals of 313,608 Dths
and an annual capacity of 23 million Dths.  The initial terms of these
contracts vary with the last one expiring in October 2003.  This storage
effectively replaces storage used by the pipeline companies to provide gas
sales service to the WEGO in the pre-FERC Order 636 environment.  Gas stored
at these facilities is purchased by the WEGO from a number of suppliers.

The WEGO has 12 transportation contracts, the last of which expires in 2003,
that it uses to meet daily customer requirements and to inject and withdraw
from gas storage.  In each case, subject to certain provisions, the WEGO can
extend the terms of these contracts at the time the agreements would otherwise
expire.

The WEGO also has three contracts for salt dome storage that provide gas
supply backup in the event of well freeze-off or other loss of supply.

The WEGO transports gas for its customers who purchase gas directly from other
suppliers.  Transported gas accounted for approximately 32% of total therms
delivered during 1995, 30% during 1994 and 31% during 1993.

There were 357,030 natural gas customers at December 31, 1995, an increase of
approximately 2.9% since December 31, 1994.  For further information by
customer class, see "Gas Revenues, Therms Delivered and Customer Statistics"
in Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The WEGO delivers natural gas to WE's Concord and Paris Combustion Turbine
Power Plants.  Deliveries to these peaking power plants are at rates approved
by the PSCW.  See Item 1. BUSINESS - "SOURCES OF GENERATION - Natural Gas (for
Electric Generation)" above.

In 1995, the PSCW issued WE a certificate for construction of a gas pipeline
to provide gas transportation service to LS Power's proposed Whitewater
cogeneration facility.  For additional information, see Item 1. BUSINESS -
"ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS" above.


SALES TO LARGE CUSTOMERS

WE provides utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers. 
Major industries served by the electric operations include the iron ore mining
industry, the paper industry, the machinery production industry, the foundry
industry and the food products industry.  The Empire and Tilden iron ore
mines, the two largest electric customers of WE, accounted for 4.5% and 3.9%,
respectively, of total electric kilowatt-hour sales in 1995.  Sales to the

mines were 0.5% lower in 1995 compared to 1994.  In January 1996, new power
purchase agreements were executed with both mines which extend the term of the
agreements by five years, through December 31, 2002.  See Item 7. 
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Electric Revenues, Gross Margins and
Sales."  Major industries served by the WEGO include the paper industry, the
food products industry and the fabricated metal products industry.  During
1995, WE's electric operations was the largest gas customer using 2.4% of
total therm deliveries.  No single retail customer of the gas utility
accounted for more than 2.1% of total gas therms sold and transported in 1995.


STEAM UTILITY OPERATIONS

WE operates a district steam system in Downtown Milwaukee and the near
southside of Downtown Milwaukee.  Steam is used by 473 customers for
processing, space heating, domestic hot water and humidification.  Annual
sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and
variations in normalized weather conditions.  Steam is supplied to the system
from WE's Valley Power Plant, a coal-fired cogeneration facility.

The steam system consists of approximately 30 miles of both high pressure and
low pressure steam piping, 3.8 miles of walkable tunnels and other pressure
regulating equipment.  Steam sales in 1995 were 2.53 billion pounds of steam
as compared to 2.39 billion pounds sold in 1994, an increase of 5.8%.

Milwaukee County Power Plant:  WE has entered into an agreement with Milwaukee
County to acquire in 1996 the steam production and distribution facilities of
the Milwaukee County Power Plant located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  WE plans to integrate these facilities into its current
steam utility operations.  This acquisition is contingent upon approval of the
PSCW and upon the five major customers signing ten-year steam service
agreements.  See Item 1. BUSINESS - "ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS" above and
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital
Requirements 1996-2000."


NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

WEC non-utility subsidiaries include the following:

WISPARK Corporation develops and invests in real estate projects within WEC's
utility subsidiary's service territories.  WISPARK is currently developing
several industrial/business parks in southeastern Wisconsin.  WISPARK's
primary development is LakeView Corporate Park, a 1,439 acre business park
located near Kenosha, Wisconsin.  WISPARK has developed 500 acres for a total
of 47 companies in LakeView during its first seven years.  WISPARK is also
developing another business park in the City of Kenosha in addition to
business parks in Pewaukee and New Berlin (Waukesha County), Yorkville (Racine
County) and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  WISPARK has also been involved in the
development of East Pointe Commons, a housing and retail complex in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.  A WISPARK subsidiary, Syndesis Development Corporation, has
developed Gaslight Pointe, a residential complex, also featuring a hotel and
restaurant, on 12 acres along the Lake Michigan waterfront in Racine,
Wisconsin.

WITECH Corporation ("WITECH") is a venture capital company operating in
Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  At December 31, 1995, WITECH
had investments in 17 companies and 3 funds totaling more than $44 million. 
The companies include, among others, an operator of a nationwide data
communications network for the agriculture industry, a specialty printing
firm, a manufacturer of motor drives and a manufacturer of customized
furniture.  

Wisconsin Michigan Investment Corporation ("WMIC") engages in investing and
financing activities.  Activities include advances to affiliated companies and
investments in financial instruments and in partnerships developing low- and
moderate-income housing projects.  Other investments may be made from time to
time.  WMIC's subsidiary, WMF Corp., engages in financing activities; any
funds obtained by WMF Corp. through financing arrangements are advanced to
WMIC.

Badger Service Company holds coal rights in Indiana.  Estimates indicate that
40 million tons of coal could be recovered from this property with
conventional mining techniques; however, there are no current plans to develop
the property.  Badger Service Company may sell or develop these rights in the
future as conditions warrant.

Minergy Corp., formerly a subsidiary of WITECH, is engaged in the business of
developing and marketing proprietary technologies designed to convert high
volume industrial and municipal wastes into value-added products.  Minergy is
proposing to build a $45 million facility in Neenah, Wisconsin that would
recycle paper sludge from area paper mills into two usable and sellable
products: glass aggregate and steam.  The plant will also provide substantial
environmental and economic benefits to the area by providing a beneficial
alternative to landfilling paper sludge.  See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES - Nonutility Investments."

WISVEST Corporation ("WISVEST") invests in energy-related entities. 
Currently, it is an investor in a company which provides strategic energy
management services with a focus on natural gas management.  WISVEST is also
an investor in a company which markets an advanced energy information system
to utilities which gives them the ability to communicate directly with its
customers.

WEC is subject to certain restrictions which limit diversification in non-
utility activities.  Under Wisconsin law, the sum of the assets of all non-
utility affiliates in a holding company system of any holding company formed
on or after November 28, 1985, may not exceed the sum of the following:

- - 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates in the holding company
  system engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric
  power.

- - A percentage of the assets, as determined by the PSCW, which may be more,
  but may not be less, than 25% of all public utility affiliates in the
  holding company system engaged in providing utility service other than the
  generation, transmission or distribution of electric power.

  assets devoted to public utility service, other than the generation,
  transmission and distribution of electric power, multiplied by a percentage,
  as determined by the PSCW, which may be more, but may not be less, than 25%,
  plus 25% of all remaining assets of the public utility affiliate.

Milwaukee County Power Plant:  As part of the agreement between WE and
Milwaukee County, a non-utility affiliate of WEC will acquire in 1996 the
chilled water production and distribution facilities of the Milwaukee County
Power Plant located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. 
The Company plans to operate these facilities as a non-regulated business. 
This acquisition is contingent upon approval by the PSCW of the acquisition of
the related steam facilities noted above and upon the five major customers
signing ten-year chilled water service agreements.  See Item 1. BUSINESS -
"ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS" above and Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND

REGULATION

WE is subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas and
steam rates in Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities,
construction of new facilities, transactions with affiliates, levels of short-
term debt obligations, billing practices and various other matters.  WE is
also subject to the regulation of the MPSC as to the various matters
associated with retail electric service in Michigan as noted above except as
to issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, levels of
short-term debt obligations and advance approval of transactions with
affiliates.  WE, with respect to hydro-electric facilities, wholesale power
service, electric transmission, gas transportation and accounting, is subject
to FERC regulation.  Operation and construction relating to WE's Point Beach
facilities are subject to regulation by the NRC.  WE's operations are also
subject to regulations of the EPA, the DNR and the MDEQ.

The PSCW is authorized to direct expenditures for promoting conservation if it
determines that the programs are in the public interest.  Rate orders have
consistently included provisions for substantial conservation programs
initiated by WE.  For additional information, see Note A - "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

WEC is an exempt holding company by order of the SEC under Section 3(a)(1) of
PUHCA and accordingly is exempt from the provisions of that act, other than
with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility.  It
will become a registered public utility holding company under PUHCA upon
consummation of the Transaction to form Primergy.  See Item 1. BUSINESS -
"MERGER AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN STATES POWER COMPANY" above.

WE is subject to a power plant siting law in Wisconsin which requires that
electric utilities file updated long-term forecasts and plans (called "Advance
Plans") for the location, size and type of future large generating plants and
high voltage transmission lines about every two years for PSCW approval after
public hearings.  Generally, the law provides that the PSCW may not authorize
the construction of any large generating plants or high voltage transmission

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Regulation - (cont'd)

lines unless they are in substantial compliance with the most recently
approved plan.  The law also prohibits WE from acquiring any interest in land
for such plants or transmission lines by condemnation until construction
authorization has been received.  Advance Plan orders are based on a review of
the utilities' long-term planning options.  However, separate project-specific
PSCW approval is required for the construction of generating facilities and
transmission lines.

WE employs a least-cost integrated planning process, which examines a full
range of supply and demand side options to meet its customers' electric needs,
such as the renovation of existing power plants, promotion of cost-effective
conservation and load management options, development of renewable energy
sources, purchased power and construction of new company-owned generation
facilities.

For additional information regarding Advance Plans, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -
"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000."

In 1994, the PSCW ordered the state's utilities to competitively bid all new
generation needs in excess of 12 megawatts to be built in Wisconsin.  The two-
stage process established by the PSCW consists of: (1) an all-parties
(including utilities) bidding procedure for fossil-fueled and renewable
generation projects and (2) the conventional Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity ("CPCN") procedure for the winner or winners.  For additional

CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000."

In 1992, the PSCW ordered that utilities should include a cost of $15 per ton
of carbon dioxide ("CO2") when comparing resource planning options (both
supply and demand-side) to account for the economic risk of future greenhouse
gas regulation.  Appeals through 1993 and 1994 did not substantially change
the order.  Recent supply and DSM plans included the greenhouse gas adder. 
There are only minor differences in supply and DSM plans prepared with and
without the greenhouse gas adder.

PSCW Electric Utility Industry Investigation:  The PSCW has conducted an
investigation into the state of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin,
particularly its institutional structure and regulatory regime, in order to
evaluate what changes would be beneficial for Wisconsin.  In early 1995, the
PSCW formed an Electric Advisory Committee (the "Committee") comprised of
representatives from the utility, independent power and merchant businesses as
well as environmental and consumer advocates.  The Committee met throughout
the year and discussed all aspects of the business to determine where the
introduction of competition would benefit consumers.  The PSCW used the input
from the Committee to develop their proposal for restructuring of the
industry.  The PSCW's proposal would permit all consumers to choose their
electricity provider as well as a competitive generation business.  The
transmission and distribution portions of the business would remain regulated. 
Several work groups and studies were recommended in the proposal to resolve
various issues that will allow for full retail competition by the year 2001.  
WE will work throughout 1996 participating in these work groups and studies.  

The restructuring envisioned in the proposal is similar to WE's view of
industry restructuring where all electric utility functions are separated into
two major categories - natural monopolies and competitive entities.  The

                                    - 23 -
<PAGE> 24
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Regulation - (cont'd)

natural monopolies are functions where a single entity can provide the lowest
cost (the transmission and distribution functions).  The competitive entities
are functions where competition can provide the lowest cost (the generation
and energy merchant functions).

In WE's model, the re-regulated natural monopolies are the transmission and
distribution functions.  Re-regulation of these entities would involve some
form of price cap and performance-standard operation rules.  In the new
structure, the FERC would regulate the transmission systems through a regional
transmission group to ensure open access, comparable pricing, comparable
service and adequate cost recovery.  The PSCW would regulate the distribution
function for reasonable price, reliability, public safety and customer
satisfaction.  

The competitive entities in the WE model are the generation, customer service
and energy merchant functions.  In the restructured electric utility industry,
utilities would unbundle costs into the individual components of generation,
transmission, distribution and service.  

PSCW Natural Gas Utility Industry Investigation:  The PSCW continued a generic
investigation of the natural gas industry in Wisconsin and addressed the
extent to which traditional regulation should be replaced with a different
approach.  In conjunction with this generic investigation, the PSCW staff is
reviewing the use of the current purchased gas adjustment ("PGA") mechanism
which is designed to pass on to gas customers increases or decreases in the
cost of natural gas purchased for resale.  A separate docket has been
established to review the PGA.  WE is participating in these PSCW
investigations.

For additional information regarding the PSCW electric and gas utility
industry investigations, see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Rates
and Regulatory Matters."


RATE MATTERS

See Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - "RATE MATTERS" and Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -
"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Rates and Regulatory Matters" for a discussion of
rate matters, including recent rate changes and a discussion of the tariffs
and procedures with respect to recovery of changes in the costs of fuel,
purchased power and gas purchased for resale.


ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Utility involvement in energy efficiency is an area in which there may be
significant changes in the future as a result of the PSCW electric utility
industry investigation mentioned earlier.  There was general agreement on the
Committee to begin to move responsibility for energy efficiency away from
utilities and toward competitive market forces.

WE has begun to move in this direction by reducing the areas in which it
provides direct customer rebates.  For industrial and commercial electric and
natural gas customers, WE continues to provide energy evaluations identifying
cost-effective customer saving opportunities, as well as below market rate
financing for the purchase of energy efficiency equipment.  In 1995, WE hired

                                    - 24 -
<PAGE> 25
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Energy Efficiency - (cont'd)

a contractor to obtain energy efficiency among smaller customers, in part to
help develop the market for energy efficiency among these customers.  The
contractor offers incentives for electric and natural gas customers to
encourage the purchase of energy efficient equipment and the removal of older
inefficient appliances from the system.

Efficient use of energy is not limited to reduced consumption.  Time-of-use
rates for certain electric customers promote the shifting of electricity usage
to those times when electric generating facilities are not fully utilized.  
Interruptible and curtailable rates, along with an energy cooperative-managed
load curtailment program, are offered to certain industrial customers to
control peak demand.  Direct load control of central air conditioners is
available to most residential customers.


ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements
resulted in capital expenditures by WEC's utility subsidiary of approximately
$31 million in 1995.  Expenditures incurred during 1995 included costs
associated with the replacement of the precipitators at Valley Power Plant,
the construction of the ISFSI at Point Beach and the installation of pollution
abatement facilities at WE's power plants, as well as the installation of
underground distribution lines and environmental studies associated with power
plants.  Such expenditures are budgeted at approximately $15 million for 1996.

Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses of WE's fly ash removal
equipment and other environmental protection systems are estimated to have
been $41 million in 1995.  Other environmental costs, primarily for
environmental studies, amounted to $200,000 in 1995.

Solid Waste Landfills

WEC's utility subsidiary provides for the disposal of non-ash related solid
wastes and hazardous wastes through licensed independent contractors, but
federal statutory provisions impose joint and several liability on the
generators of waste for certain cleanup costs.  Remediation-related activity
pertaining to specific sites is discussed below.

Muskego Sanitary Landfill:  In 1992, WE was informed by the EPA that it was
included in a group of approximately 50 potentially responsible parties
("PRPs") against which the EPA will issue orders requiring that the PRPs clean
up the Muskego Sanitary Landfill (located in Southeastern Waukesha County,
Wisconsin).  On January 14, 1993, WE notified EPA that it was proceeding, with
other PRPs, to comply with the order.  The first step toward remediation has
been identified, with the WE portion of the $16.8 million effort identified as
$115,000 (paid in 1994).  Remedial actions for the second step (Groundwater
Operable Unit Remedy) are being evaluated, with EPA recommending a limited
pump and treat option, estimated to cost $7.4 million.  Costs will be
allocated among the PRPs based on their waste contribution to the site.  WE
has been identified as one of the small waste contributors required to
contribute to the groundwater cleanup.

Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site: In 1986, WE was advised by EPA that it is
one of a number of PRPs for cleanup at this low-level radioactive waste site
located in Morehead, Kentucky.  The amount of waste contributed by WE was
significantly less than one percent of the total.  Under the terms of a


                                    - 25 -
<PAGE> 26
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Environmental Compliance - (cont'd)

consent decree agreed to by all parties, WE was to pay the amount of $164,000
(minus a small credit for an amount previously paid) as its share of the
settlement fund for site cleanup costs.  This settlement was to be completed
in 1995, but has been held up by a lawsuit filed by the unions concerning the
amount of work on the cleanup to be done by union labor.  The potential impact
on WE would be a limited increase in the settlement if additional labor costs
result from the lawsuit.

Manistique River/Harbor Area: WE received a request for information or PRP
letter from EPA on March 12, 1993.  The letter states that the river/harbor
has PCB contamination.  EPA has requested information regarding company PCB
and oil filled equipment management in the Manistique River drainage basin. 
WE responded to this request on April 22, 1993.  An additional information
request from EPA was responded to on January 4, 1995.  WE has no reason to
believe that it is responsible in total or in part for the PCB contamination
in the Manistique River/harbor area.  WE has learned through newspaper
articles that the EPA announced a preliminary plan to dredge most of the PCB-
contaminated sediments, with only limited capping along the breakwater.  The
two identified PRPs, Manistique Papers and Edison Sault Electric Company, have
advocated installation of a permanent cap.  

Kenosha Iron and Metal:  WE received a request for information or PRP letter
from EPA on December 9, 1994.  The letter requested information regarding any
involvement WE's Pleasant Prairie Power Plant may have had with this operation
in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  A response to EPA was sent December 29, 1994,
indicating that WE had no reason to believe that the power plant or WE did any
business with Kenosha Iron and Metal.  No response from EPA has been received
since this response.

Marina Cliffs Barrel Dump Site: WE received a special notice letter and
information request on March 25, 1994 from the DNR.  The letter described a
release of hazardous substances at a former barrel reclamation facility and
landfill site, located in the City of South Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and
requested information on any business dealings WE may have had with this
former operation.  This request for information was responded to on 
April 26, 1994.  An additional request for information or PRP letter, was
received on March 24, 1995.  This request was responded to by WE in April
1995.  Since that time a number of follow-up contacts have been made with EPA. 
WE has no reason to believe that it is responsible for the contamination
problems at this site.  While WE continues to believe it has no responsibility
at this site, the EPA, which has undertaken remediation activities at the
site, has refused to offer WE a buyout option.  As a result, WE has joined a
group of PRPs who will fund the cleanup.  No known cleanup schedule has been
set or remediation costs identified.

ETSM Property: Iron cyanide bearing wastes were found both on property owned
by WE (ETSM facility), located in the City of West Allis, Wisconsin, and
adjacent landowners.  The wastes were removed and properly disposed, with WE's
share of the cleanup at about $100,000.  Adjacent landowners believe WE to be
the source of the material; however, records do not support that allegation. 
WE has received a notice sent by one of the property owners, of its intent to
sue WE under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.

City of West Allis: The City of West Allis, Wisconsin discovered iron cyanide
bearing wastes on a parcel of property owned by the city at 113th St. and
Greenfield Ave.  The source of the waste is believed to be process waste
hauled to the site from a former manufactured gas plant.  The City of West

<PAGE> 27
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Environmental Compliance - (cont'd)

Allis alleges that WE was the source of this material and is pursuing action
against WE to remediate the site.  This matter is pending.  There is no reason
to believe that WE nor WN was the source of or involved in the disposal of the
iron cyanide bearing wastes on this property.

Lenz Oil: A request for information or PRP letter was received from EPA on
March 25, 1994.  WSG was identified as the PRP because of used oil sent to the
Lenz Oil facility located in Lemont, Illinois.  WSG was acquired by WEC on
January 1, 1994.  A response was filed with EPA.  No known cleanup schedule
has been set or remediation costs identified.

Boundary Road Landfill: WE was contacted by Waste Management, Inc. ("WMI") in
October 1995 requesting voluntary participation in the cleanup of its former
landfill.  The landfill, formerly known as the Lauer Landfill, is a Superfund
site located in the Village of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  WMI is alleging
that waste from some of WE's service centers was disposed of at this site and
is now contributing to the environmental problems at the site.  WE met with
WMI on February 12, 1996 to discuss the situation.  No known cleanup schedule
has been set or remediation costs identified.  This matter is pending.

Lake Geneva Service Center: The property, in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, was
acquired as part of the acquisition of WSG.  A groundwater problem was
identified by WSG reportedly caused by past disposal practices.  In 1995, the
extent of contamination was defined, and a remediation system was designed and
installed.  Approximately $200,000 was spent in 1995.  Remaining remediation
costs are estimated to be approximately $150,000.

Ash Landfills

WE aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses of its
combustion byproducts.  However, ash materials have been, and to some degree,
continue to be disposed of in company-owned, licensed landfills.  Some early
designed and constructed landfills may allow the release of low levels of
constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation.  Where
WE has become aware of these conditions, efforts have been expended to define
the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address
these conditions.  These costs are included in the environmental operating and
maintenance costs for WE.  Sites currently undergoing remediation include:

Presque Isle Landfill:  WE entered into a consent order with the MDNR (now the
MDEQ) regarding conditions existing at an ash landfill site acquired by WE
when it purchased the Presque Isle Power Plant in 1988.  WE's groundwater
monitoring program at the site detected elevated levels of certain substances
at the oldest portion of the landfill.  WE has reconstructed, closed and
capped the landfill to prevent further leachate from entering the groundwater
at an approximate cost of $2.6 million.  A Remedial Action Plan was submitted
to the MDEQ in 1995 that includes limited groundwater monitoring to further
document the improvement in groundwater quality that has occurred at the site. 
The cost to implement the Remedial Action Plan is estimated to not exceed
$100,000.

Highway 59 Landfill:  In 1989, a sulfate plume was detected in the groundwater
beneath a WE-owned former ash landfill located in the Town of Waukesha,
Wisconsin.  After notifying the DNR, WE initiated a five-year expanded




                                    - 27 -

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - Environmental Compliance - (cont'd)

monitoring program.  In response to a request from the DNR, WE prepared an
environmental contamination assessment of the landfill and submitted the
report to the DNR in July 1995.  WE believes that any remediation plan
developed, approved and implemented for this site would not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition.  

Manufactured Gas Sites

WE's natural gas business unit is investigating the remediation of a number of
former manufactured gas plant ("MGP") sites.  Operation at these MGP sites
ceased over 40 years ago.  Limited remediation activities occurred at a number
of these sites during the 1980's, with removal of waste materials known to be
present at the time.  In 1995, WE presented a plan to investigate and further
remediate sites to the DNR.  During 1995, WE conducted site investigations  at
four MGP sites and partial remediation activities were conducted at one site. 
Approximately $1.6 million has been spent through December 31, 1995 for such
activities.  Remediation costs to be incurred through the year 2000 have been
estimated to be $12 million, but the total costs are uncertain pending results
of further site specific investigations and the selection of site specific
remedial actions.  In its September 11, 1995 letter order, the PSCW allowed WE
to defer MGP site remediation costs with final rate treatment of such costs to
be determined in future rate cases.  As of December 31, 1995, WE has recorded
an accrued liability of $1.6 million for MGP site remediation and a related
deferred regulatory asset of $3.2 million.  WE expects to accrue additional
MGP site remediation liabilities during 1996 as site specific investigations
are completed and site specific remedial actions are identified.  WE  will
seek rate recovery of these costs and does not anticipate that there will be a
material adverse effect on its net income or financial condition.

Air Quality - Acid Rain Legislation

In 1986, the Wisconsin Legislature passed legislation establishing new sulfur
dioxide ("SO2") limitations applicable to Wisconsin's five major electric
utilities, including WE.  The law requires each of the five major electric
utilities to meet a 1.20 lb SO2 per million BTU corporate average annual
emission rate limit beginning in 1993.  Prior to 1993, Wisconsin law limited
the total annual SO2 emissions from the five major electric utilities to
500,000 tons per year.  During 1995, approximately 177,000 tons of SO2 were
emitted by such utilities, equivalent to an annual average emission rate of
0.88 lbs SO2 per million BTU.

WE's compliance plan to meet the SO2 limitations under Wisconsin's acid rain
law includes the increased use of low-sulfur coal at certain power plant
units.  Some changes to existing power plant equipment were made to
accommodate the use of low-sulfur coals.

The 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act mandate significant
nationwide reductions in air emissions.  Most significant to the country's
electric utility companies are the "acid rain" provisions of the amendments
which are scheduled to limit SO2 and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions in
phases.  Phase I became effective in 1995 and Phase II will take effect in
2000.  Phase I requirements had minimal impact on the Company because of
actions taken to meet the above-mentioned Wisconsin acid rain law.  Phase II
requirements, together with separate ozone nonattainment provisions of the
Clean Air Act which may call for additional NOX reductions, however, will
necessitate the implementation of a compliance strategy which is not expected

to materially impact rates.  Since a portion of the regulations that have been
issued by the EPA are not complete or are not yet final, the rate impact is
subject to change and will be reevaluated as needed.

Amendments, including estimates of the cost of compliance, see Item 7.

OTHER

WE is authorized to provide electric and gas service in designated territories
in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits,
certificates of public convenience and necessity, or boundary agreements with
other utilities.  WE provides electric service in certain territories in the
state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities.

Research and development expenditures of WEC's utility subsidiary amounted to
$6,427,000 in 1995, $8,063,000 in 1994 and $8,629,000 in 1993.  Such
expenditures were primarily for improvement of service and abatement of air
and water pollution.  Research and development activities include work done by
employees, consultants and contractors, plus sponsorship of research by
industry associations.  In addition to the foregoing amounts, the WEGO paid
$1,033,000 in 1995, $766,000 in 1994 and $1,300,000 in 1993 for support of the
Gas Research Institute ("GRI").  The GRI surcharge, currently assessed on all
gas deliveries, is calculated on pipeline utilization.

At December 31, 1995, WEC and its subsidiaries employed 4,514 persons, of
which 95 were part-time.

adjust rates to reflect varying fuel costs for all customers except for a
large volume contract representing approximately 13% of steam sales in 1995. 
WE believes that it has the ability to maintain low fuel costs through
efficient management of its power supply system and fuel procurement
practices.  Therefore, WE has proposed, in its 1997 Test Year filing with the
PSCW, the elimination of the retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure.

1995 Fuel Cost Adjustment:  Effective August 4, 1994, the PSCW authorized WE
to reduce Wisconsin retail electric rates, through the use of a fuel
adjustment credit, to reflect lower fuel and purchased power expenses.  The
adjustment reduced Wisconsin retail electric revenue by approximately $16.7
million through December 31, 1995.  Effective January 1, 1996, the fuel
adjustment credit was removed from Wisconsin retail electric rates.  Under
WE's proposal in the 1997 Test Year filing to eliminate the fuel cost
adjustment credit, the level of fuel expense currently included in rates will
continue until rates are revised by the PSCW in a rate case.

Purchased Gas Adjustment Tariffs:  Sales of natural gas are subject to
adjustment tariffs designed to pass on to gas customers increases or decreases
in the cost of natural gas purchased for resale.  For additional information,
see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Rates and Regulatory
Matters."

1995 Test Year:  In 1993 the PSCW discontinued the practice of conducting
annual rate case proceedings, replacing it with a new schedule which calls for
future biennial rate cases.  As a result, no electric, gas or steam filings
were made with respect to the 1995 test year.

1996 Test Year:  On May 1, 1995, WE filed with the PSCW required data related
to the 1996 test year.  This was an abbreviated filing since no increase in
rates was requested.  At the PSCW's open meeting on August 21, 1995, the PSCW
determined that Wisconsin retail rates for 1996 should be decreased from
existing levels.  In a letter order dated September 11, 1995, the PSCW
directed WE to implement rate decreases for Wisconsin retail electric, gas and
steam customers of $33.383 million or 2.75%, $8.298 million or 2.6% and $0.790
million or 5.1%, respectively, on an annualized basis effective January 1,
1996.  The decrease is based upon a regulatory return on common equity of
11.3%, down from 12.3% authorized since 1993.

1997 Test Year:  On January 16, 1996, WE filed specific financial data with
the PSCW related to the 1997 test year showing an $82.2 million revenue
deficiency for its utility operations.  The dollar impacts and percentage
increases requested for Wisconsin retail electric, gas and steam customers are
$77.0 million or 6.2%, $4.3 million or 1.4% and $0.9 million or 6.4%,
respectively, on an annualized basis.  On March 15, 1996, WE filed testimony
and exhibits with the PSCW related to the 1997 test year.  The PSCW had
determined that it required a special full review of WE's rates for the 1997
test year in connection with consideration of the application for approval of
the proposed merger of WEC and NSP.  For additional information regarding the
merger of WEC and NSP, see Item 1. BUSINESS - "MERGER AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN
STATES POWER COMPANY", Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -
Mergers" and Note B - "Mergers" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Rate Matters - (cont'd) 

Wholesale Electric Jurisdiction

Fuel and Purchased Power Adjustment Tariffs:  Some customers served under WE's
wholesale rates are subject to an automatic fuel adjustment provision to
reflect varying fuel and purchased power costs.  Wholesale sales to municipals
and cooperatives represented approximately 5% of total electric sales in 1995.

Michigan Retail Electric Jurisdiction

1996 Test Year:  Effective January 1, 1996, the MPSC authorized an annualized
rate decrease of $1.13 million or 3.3% for WE's non-mine retail electric
customers.  Excluding sales to the two mine customers, which are separately
regulated by the MPSC, retail electric sales in Michigan account for
approximately 2% of WE's total kilowatt-hour sales.

Power Supply Cost Recovery Clause:  In the past, rates were adjusted to
reflect varying fuel and purchased power costs through a power supply cost
recovery ("PSCR") clause in WE's tariffs.  Such PSCR clause provided for,
among other things, an annual filing of a PSCR plan and, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, the development of PSCR factors to be applied to
customers' bills during the period covered by the PSCR plan to allow WE to
recover its costs of fuel and purchased power transactions, as estimated in
its annual filing.  The amounts so collected were subject to a reconciliation
proceeding conducted by the MPSC at the end of the period covered by the plan
for recovery of any undercollections of actual costs or for refund or credit
of any amounts in excess of its actual costs in such period.  On 
November 30, 1994, the MPSC approved the proposed PSCR credit factor of
$.00535 per kilowatt-hour for the year 1995.  Effective December 15, 1995, the
MPSC authorized suspension of the PSCR clause for a five-year period.  The
existing PSCR credit factor of $.00535 per kilowatt-hour was rolled into the
energy rate.

FERC Order 636 Transition Costs

As a result of the FERC's Order 636, pipeline companies are no longer in the
merchant business and are billing transition costs, such as Gas Supply
Realignment and stranded capacity costs, to their customers.  Due to the
netting of refunds against liabilities in 1995, the net remaining transition
costs to be billed to WE are currently estimated to be $2.0 million.  This
estimate includes the amount attributable to WSG, which was merged into WN
effective January 1, 1994.  The PSCW is allowing local gas distribution
companies to pass these costs on to their customers through the purchased gas
adjustment mechanism.

For additional information see Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Rates
and Regulatory Matters."

Stray Voltage

In March 1996, technical hearings were concluded in a PSCW proceeding to
further evaluate the results of stray voltage research that has been completed
since 1989 and to update, if necessary, PSCW policies regarding stray voltage
that were included in a 1989 PSCW order.  WE expects the PSCW to issue an
updated order on stray voltage in April 1996 but does not anticipate that it
will have a significant impact on WE's financial position or results of
operations.

OTHER LITIGATION

Spent Fuel Storage and Disposal:  See Item 1. BUSINESS - "SOURCES OF
GENERATION - Nuclear" for information concerning the PSCW's approval of WE's
application to utilize dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel generated at
Point Beach Nuclear Plant and pending legal proceedings with respect to the
PSCW's decision.

Pittsburg & Midway Case:  In a matter brought before the FERC, in July 1993,
WE filed an initial brief supporting its right to retain coal reclamation
costs collected through the wholesale fuel adjustment clause in 1986 that it
believes were prudently incurred in a settlement with the Pittsburg & Midway
Coal Mining Company.  Of the total costs involved, the portion recovered
through the wholesale fuel clause amounts to approximately $750,000.  This
filing was made in response to a FERC audit staff determination that WE should
have applied for a waiver of the FERC's fuel clause regulations in order to
attempt to pass through the wholesale portion of the settlement costs.  On
December 13, 1995, the administrative law judge issued an initial decision
that WE was required to refund the portion of such costs collected from its
wholesale customers.  The administrative law judge's initial decision found in
favor of WE with respect to the prudence of the administration of the coal
contracts.  The matter is pending before the full commission.

In November 1993, the FERC rejected WE's request to be allowed to recover, in
wholesale rates in the future, the amount which may have to be refunded to
customers in the event of an unfavorable ruling in the pending fuel adjustment
clause proceeding concerning the Pittsburg & Midway reclamation charges.  In
January 1994, WE filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit regarding this rejection.  The matter is pending.

Electromagnetic Fields:  Claims are being made or threatened with increasing
frequency against electric utilities across the country for bodily injury,
disease or other damages allegedly caused or aggravated by exposure to
electromagnetic fields ("EMFs") associated with electric transmission and
distribution lines.  Results of scientific studies conducted to date do not
establish the existence of a causal connection between EMFs and any adverse
health effects.  WE believes that its facilities are constructed and operated
in accordance with all applicable legal requirements and standards.  WE does
not believe that any claims thus far made or threatened against it in
connection with EMFs will result in any substantial liability on the part of
WE.

Uranium Enrichment Charges:  On February 9, 1995, WE and ten other utilities
filed an action against the USEC in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims
challenging the final decision of the USEC contracting officer in November
1994 which denied claims of the utilities for damages by reason of overcharges
for uranium enrichment services provided under Utility Services Contracts
between July 1, 1993 and September 30, 1994.  The damages sought by WE total
$3.3 million.  The matter is pending.

Personal Injury Suit: On October 1, 1994, a jury returned a $2.85 million
verdict against WN, which was merged into WE effective January 1, 1996, in a
case in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, involving a gas pipe fire
which injured the plaintiff.  On December 23, 1994, WN resolved the litigation
between itself and plaintiff with a payment of $2.55 million to plaintiff, of
which $550,000 was covered by WN's general liability insurer.  The contract
with the construction company that installed the gas pipe provides for

indemnification of WN.  On September 8, 1995, WN commenced an action for such

company and its insurers.  The matter is pending.

DIVIDEND POLICY OF PRIMERGY

In accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement between WEC and
Northern States Power Company ("NSP") to form Primergy Corporation
("Primergy"), each share of WEC common stock will become 1.0 share of Primergy
common stock and each share of NSP common stock will be converted into 1.626
shares (the "Ratio) of Primergy common stock upon consummation of the
Transaction.  It is anticipated that Primergy will adopt NSP's common share
dividend payment level adjusted for the Ratio.  NSP currently pays $2.70 per
share annually while WEC's annual dividend rate is currently $1.47 per share. 
Based on the Ratio and NSP's current dividend rate, the pro forma dividend
rate for Primergy would be $1.66 per share at December 31, 1995.  However, no
assurance can be given that such dividend rate will be in effect or will
remain unchanged, and Primergy reserves the right to increase or decrease its
dividend as may be required by law or contract or as may be determined by the
Primergy Board of Directors, in its discretion, to be advisable.  Declaration
and timing of dividends on Primergy common stock will be a business decision
to be made by the Primergy Board from time to time based upon the results of
operations and financial condition of Primergy and its subsidiaries and such
other business considerations as the Primergy Board considers relevant in
accordance with applicable laws.  Additional information concerning the
proposed merger of WEC and NSP may be found in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION - "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers" and in Note B - "Mergers" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective January 1, 1996, Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("WEC" or the
"Company") merged its natural gas utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Natural Gas
Company ("WN"), into its electric and steam utility subsidiary, Wisconsin
Electric Power Company ("WE"), to form a single combined utility subsidiary. 
Where applicable, references to WE include WN prior to the merger.  Additional
information concerning the merger may be found below under "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers" and in Note B - "Mergers" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS.

As previously reported, WEC has entered into an agreement with Northern States
Power Company, a Minnesota corporation ("NSP"), which provides for a strategic
business combination involving the two companies in a "merger-of-equals"
transaction.  The future operations and financial position of the Company will
be significantly affected by the proposed merger.  Consummation of the
proposed merger is subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining all
required regulatory approvals.  Additional information concerning such
agreement and proposed transaction may be found below under "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers", in MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS - "Dividend Policy of Primergy" and in Note B - "Mergers"
in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (including unaudited pro forma financial
information).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

1995 Compared to 1994:  Earnings per share of WEC's common stock in 1995 were
$2.13 compared with $1.67 per share in 1994, an increase of 27.5%.  Earnings
during 1994 reflect a nonrecurring charge of approximately $73.9 million ($45
million net of tax, or 42 cents per share) associated with the organizational
restructuring program at WE.

The 1994 nonrecurring charge primarily included the costs of early retirement
and severance packages which were elements of a revitalization program
("Revitalization") designed to better position the Company in a changing
energy marketplace.  The Company has recovered the 1994 nonrecurring charge in
avoided labor costs that would have been charged to Other Operations and
Maintenance expense during 1994 and 1995.

Excluding the Revitalization charge, 1995 earnings per share of common stock
were 1.9% greater than 1994 earnings per share of $2.09.  The increase in 1995
earnings reflects 1.4% higher electric sales, 9.3% higher gas deliveries and a
3.1% decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses.  Electric sales
grew primarily as a result of warmer summer weather during 1995.  Gas
deliveries increased due to increased deliveries to Interruptible and
Transportation customers and to colder weather during the fourth quarter of
1995.  Additional economic activity in WE's service area also contributed to
the increase in electric sales and gas deliveries.  The reduction in Other
Operation and Maintenance expenses primarily reflects payroll-related savings
and efficiencies gained through WE's Revitalization program.

1993 Through 1995:  Earnings per share of common stock increased at a compound
annual rate of 8.9% from $1.80 in 1993 to $2.13 in 1995.  The increase in
earnings per share primarily resulted from corresponding growth in electric
sales and therm deliveries and a decline in Other Operation and Maintenance
expense.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (cont'd)

Wisconsin Electric Revitalization

In response to increasing competitive pressures in the markets for electricity
and natural gas, WE implemented Revitalization in 1994 to increase
efficiencies and improve customer service by reengineering and restructuring
the organization.  The new structure consolidated many business functions and
simplified work processes.  See Note K - "Benefits Other Than Pensions" in the
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

Mergers

Wisconsin Natural Gas Company:  As part of Revitalization, WEC has merged WN
into WE.  The merger, which was effective January 1, 1996, is expected to
improve customer service and reduce operating costs.  The accounting treatment
for this merger was similar to that which would result from a pooling of
interests.

Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc.:  Effective January 1, 1994, WEC acquired
Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc. ("WSG") through a statutory merger of WSG
into WN in which all of WSG's common stock was converted into common stock of
WEC.  WSG was a gas utility engaged in the purchase, distribution,
transportation and sale of natural gas primarily in an area of southeastern
Wisconsin which was contiguous to WN's service territory.  WSG was merged into
WN using the pooling of interests method of accounting.  Accordingly, prior
years' financial and statistical information was restated to include WSG at
historical values.

Northern States Power Company:  On April 28, 1995, WEC and NSP entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was amended and restated as of 
July 26, 1995 ("Merger Agreement").  The Merger Agreement provides for a
strategic business combination involving WEC and NSP in a "merger-of-equals"
transaction ("Transaction").  As a result, WEC will become a registered public
utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
as amended ("PUHCA"), and will change its name to Primergy Corporation
("Primergy").  Primergy will be the parent company of WE (which will be
renamed Wisconsin Energy Company), of NSP (which, for regulatory reasons, will
reincorporate in Wisconsin ("New NSP")), and of the other subsidiaries of WEC
and NSP.  In connection with the Transaction, Northern States Power Company, a
Wisconsin corporation ("NSP-WI"), currently a utility subsidiary of NSP, will
be merged into Wisconsin Energy Company.  Prior to the merger of NSP-WI into
Wisconsin Energy Company, New NSP will acquire from NSP-WI certain gas utility
assets.  The Transaction is intended to be tax free for income tax purposes
and to be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

On September 13, 1995, stockholders of WEC and NSP voted to approve the
Transaction.  Under the provisions of the Merger Agreement, each share of WEC
and NSP common stock will become 1.0 and 1.626 shares of Primergy common
stock, respectively, following the proposed Transaction.

As a result of the Transaction, the Company anticipates cost savings of
approximately $2 billion over a ten year period, net of transaction costs and
costs to achieve the savings of approximately $30 million and $122 million,
respectively.  WE and NSP have proposed, in their filings with the numerous
state jurisdictions to which they are subject, a reduction of approximately
1.5% in retail electric rates beginning on or about January 1997 (assuming
that the Transaction is then consummated) and a rate freeze through the year

2000, subject to certain exceptions regarding matters beyond WE's or NSP's
control.  For the same periods and subject to the same types of exceptions, WE
and NSP-WI have proposed a $4.2 million reduction in retail gas rates on an
annualized basis in Wisconsin and Michigan and a rate freeze through the year
2000.  Similarly, NSP anticipates proposing in 1996 a 1.25% rate reduction for
retail gas customers in North Dakota and four and two year rate freezes in
North Dakota and Minnesota, respectively, effective following consummation of
the Transaction.  Subject to the same types of exceptions noted above, WE and
NSP have agreed to a freeze in their electric wholesale rates for a four year
period subsequent to the Transaction.  In December 1995, WEC and NSP entered
into a settlement agreement with certain municipal Wisconsin intervenors that
ended the latters' participation in the FERC and state merger proceedings. 
The settlement agreement, which provides for certain rate reductions on power
sales and transmission services, is pending FERC action.  The state filings
include a request for deferred accounting treatment and rate recovery of costs
incurred associated with the Transaction.  As of December 31, 1995, WEC has
deferred $8.1 million of costs associated with the Transaction as a component
of Deferred Charges and Other Assets-Other.

The Merger Agreement is subject to various conditions including approval by
all applicable regulatory authorities.  In July 1995, WEC and NSP filed an
application and supporting testimony with the FERC seeking approval of the
Merger Agreement.  In August 1995, WEC and NSP made similar filings with
regulatory agencies in the states where WEC and NSP provide utility services
and in which such filings are required.  Applications for license amendments
and approvals relating to the Merger Agreement were filed with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission ("NRC") in the fall of 1995.  The FERC has put the
merger application on an accelerated schedule, ordering the administrative law
judge's initial decision by August 30, 1996 and briefs on exception by
September 30, 1996.  In March 1996, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
("PSCW") requested that the FERC broaden the scope of the merger application
hearing to evaluate whether the proposed Transaction will impair effective
state oversight of retail rates.  The matter is pending.  Not all of the
regulatory agencies have established a timetable for their decision.

During 1995, WEC and NSP received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
indicating that the proposed successive merger transactions defined in the
Merger Agreement would not prevent the treatment of the Transaction as a tax-
free reorganization under applicable tax law if each transaction independently
so qualified.  In 1996, WEC and NSP will file an application with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for authority to form Primergy
under the requirements of PUHCA as well as required notifications with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.  Subject to obtaining
all requisite approvals, WEC and NSP anticipate completing the Transaction by
January 1, 1997.

The SEC may require, as a condition to its approval of the Transaction, that
WEC and NSP divest their gas utility properties and possibly certain non-
utility ventures within a reasonable time after the Transaction is
consummated.  In a few cases, the SEC has allowed the retention of such
properties or deferred the question of divestiture for a substantial period of

time.  In those cases in which divestiture has taken place, the SEC has
usually allowed enough time to complete the divestiture so as to allow the
applicant to avoid a "fire sale" of the divested assets.  WEC and NSP believe
strong policy reasons and prior SEC decisions exist which support their
retaining their existing gas utility properties and non-utility ventures, or,
alternatively, which support deferring the question of divestiture for a
substantial period of time; accordingly, WEC and NSP will request in their
merger application with the SEC that WEC and NSP be allowed to retain, or, in
the alternative, that the question of divestiture be deferred with respect to,
WEC's and NSP's existing gas utility properties and non-utility ventures.

Regulatory authorities may also require the restructuring of transmission
system operations or administration.  WEC and NSP currently cannot determine
if such restructuring will be required.  In addition, Wisconsin State law
limits the total assets of non-utility affiliates of Primergy, which could
affect the amount of non-regulated operations.

Electric Revenues, Gross Margins and Sales

1995 Compared to 1994:  Despite an annualized $16 million or 1.3% Wisconsin
retail electric fuel adjustment rate decrease that became effective on 
August 4, 1994, total Electric Operating Revenues increased by 2.4% from
$1,404 million in 1994 to $1,437 million in 1995 due to increased 1995
electric sales.  The gross margin on Electric Operating Revenues (Electric
Operating Revenues less Fuel and Purchased Power expenses) increased by 1.6%
from $1,075 million in 1994 to $1,092 million in 1995.  The gross margin grew
because the increased electric sales were primarily to Residential and Small
Commercial/Industrial customers who contribute higher margins to earnings than
other customer classes.

==============================================================================

Total electric sales, detailed below by customer class, increased by 1.4% to
approximately 27,284,000 megawatt-hours in 1995 compared to 26,911,000
megawatt-hours in 1994.  Electric sales were positively impacted by
substantially warmer summer weather conditions during 1995, resulting in
increased use of electricity for air conditioning and other cooling purposes. 
As measured by cooling degree days, the 1995 cooling season (June through
August) was 27.7% warmer than the same period in 1994.  During the summer of
1995, WE experienced eight days of electric peak demands greater than the
previous record which had been set in June 1994.  The increase in electric
sales also reflects colder winter weather during the fourth quarter of 1995
and a moderate increase in economic activity in WE's service area.

==============================================================================

The warmer 1995 summer weather increased sales primarily to Residential and
Small Commercial/Industrial customers.  These customers are more sensitive to
weather variations than other customer classes.  The average number of
customers in the Residential and Small Commercial/Industrial customer classes
grew by 1.3% and 1.8% or from 846,745 and 88,765, respectively, in 1994 to
857,924 and 90,386 in 1995.

Electric energy sales to the Empire and Tilden iron ore mines, WE's two
largest customers, decreased by 0.5% to 2,296,000 megawatt-hours in 1995
compared to 2,308,000 megawatt-hours in 1994.  Excluding the mines, sales to
Large Commercial/Industrial customers increased 2.2%.

The 3.3% reduction in 1995 sales to the Other customer class is largely the
result of reductions in sales to WPPI, WE's largest municipal power agency
customer.  WPPI has been reducing its purchases from WE subsequent to
acquiring generating capacity in 1990, 1993 and 1996.  Since that time, WPPI
has expanded the use of its existing generating facilities and has installed
additional capacity, further reducing its reliance on energy purchases from
WE.  These sales reductions did not have a significant effect on earnings.

The market for electric wholesale customers (included in the Other customer
class) is increasingly competitive.  WE is in the process of renegotiating or
has renegotiated long-term power sales contracts with most of its municipal
wholesale customers.  While WE anticipates retaining most of these customers
over the long-term, WE expects that municipal wholesale revenues will begin to
decline starting in 1996 as a result of lower margins included in the
renegotiated contracts.  WE is actively seeking to obtain new municipal
wholesale customers to increase sales in this customer class.

Resale of energy to other utilities declined 31.6% in 1995.  This decline can
in part be attributed to unplanned or longer than expected outages at two of
WE's least cost generating facilities during 1995 and to increased retail
customer load as a result of the warmer summer weather, both of which reduced
the opportunity to sell electric energy to other utilities.  Additionally,
Upper Peninsula Power Company has permanently reduced the amount of energy
that it is purchasing from WE for resale.  These sales reductions did not have
a significant effect on earnings.

1993 Through 1995:  Total Electric Operating Revenues increased at a compound
annual growth rate of 3.3% or from approximately $1,348 million in 1993 to

                                    - 44 -

$1,437 million in 1995 due to increased electric sales.  Total electric sales
grew from 25,685,000 megawatt-hours in 1993 to 27,284,000 megawatt-hours in
1995, a compound annual increase of 3.1%.  These increases reflect, among
other things, more favorable weather conditions in 1995 and a moderate
increase in economic activity in WE's service area.  The gross margin on
Electric Operating Revenues increased at a compound annual rate of 3.0% from
approximately $1,030 million in 1993 to $1,092 million in 1995.  This was due
to increased electric sales to Residential and Small Commercial/Industrial
customers who contribute higher margins to earnings than other customer
classes.

From 1993 through 1995, sales to Residential and Small Commercial/Industrial
customers increased at compound annual rates of 3.7% and 5.3% or from
6,551,000 and 6,358,000 megawatt-hours, respectively, in 1993 to 7,043,000 and
7,047,000 megawatt-hours in 1995.  This increase was due primarily to warm
summer weather in 1994 and 1995.  The average number of Residential and Small
Commercial/Industrial customers has increased at compound annual rates of 1.3%
and 1.7%, respectively, during this period.

Large Commercial/Industrial sales increased from 9,771,000 megawatt-hours in
1993 to 10,640,000 megawatt-hours in 1995, a compound annual increase of 4.3%
attributable in part to a five-week long mine strike during the third quarter
of 1993 which reduced 1993 sales.  WE's contracts with the mines require the
payment of a demand charge regardless of power usage which partially offset
the impact on 1993 revenues of lost sales.  Sales to the mines represented
8.4%, 8.6% and 7.8% of total electric sales during 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

For the three year period ending with 1995, sales to the Other customer class
declined from 1,776,000 megawatt-hours in 1993 to 1,551,000 megawatt-hours in
1995, a compound annual decrease of 6.6% resulting from the decreased sales to
WPPI noted above.  Sales for Resale to other utilities declined from 1,229,000
megawatt-hours in 1993 to 1,003,000 megawatt-hours in 1995, a compound annual
decrease of 9.7% resulting from the decreased opportunity sales and the
reduction in purchases by Upper Peninsula Power Company described above.

In addition to the results of higher total electric sales, the compound annual
increase in Electric Operating Revenues since 1993 includes the impacts of
rate changes which were effective during 1993 and 1994 as shown below in
"Rates and Regulatory Matters."

Gas Revenues, Gross Margins and Sales

1995 Compared to 1994:  Despite an increase in 1995 total gas deliveries, 
total Gas Operating Revenues decreased by 1.9% or from $324 million in 1994 to
$318 million in 1995 as a result of a reduction in the cost of gas which is
recovered through the purchased gas adjustment clause.  The gross margin on
Gas Operating Revenues (Gas Operating Revenues less Cost of Gas Sold)
increased by 3.7% or from $125 million in 1994 to $129 million in 1995.  The
gross margin grew because of increased therm sales to Residential and
Commercial customers who contribute higher margins to earnings than other
customer classes.

Total natural gas therms delivered, detailed below by customer class,
increased by 9.3% or from 811,219 thousand therms in 1994 to 886,729 thousand
therms in 1995, due in part to the effects of weather.  Colder weather during
the fourth quarter of 1995 contributed to net increased deliveries for the
year.  As measured by heating degree days, the fourth quarter was 43.1% colder
than the same period in 1994.  The increase in therms delivered also reflects
the warmer summer weather conditions noted above, which increased therm
deliveries to electric peak generating stations described below, and a
moderate increase in economic activity in WE's service area.

==============================================================================

The colder fourth quarter of 1995 weather increased sales to Residential and
Commercial customers.  These customers are more sensitive to weather
variations as a result of heating requirements than other customer classes. 
The average number of Residential and Commercial/Industrial customers
increased by 3.3% and 2.7% or from 311,288 and 28,506, respectively, in 1994
to 321,643 and 29,287 in 1995.

During 1995, therm deliveries to Interruptible and Transportation customers
increased by 6.7% and 17.8%, respectively.  WE attributes these increases in
part to increased electric generation peaking requirements of its Concord
("Concord") and Paris ("Paris") Generating Stations, especially given the
warmer weather during the summer of 1995.  All of the gas fired generating
units at Concord and Paris were in operation by the end of the second quarter
of 1995 while only the generating units at Concord were in operation by the
end of the second quarter of 1994.  Deliveries to the Concord and Paris
peaking power plants are at rates approved by the PSCW.

WE transports gas for customers who purchase gas directly from other
suppliers.  Rates charged for transportation services are designed to recover
the same margin as natural gas sold directly by WE.

WE arranges for its own gas supply under contracts with terms of various
lengths.  Changes in the cost of natural gas purchased at market prices are
passed through to customers via WE's purchased gas adjustment clause.

1993 Through 1995:  While total Gas Operating Revenues decreased at a compound
annual rate of 2.0% or from $331 million in 1993 to $318 million in 1995, the
gross margin on Gas Operating Revenues increased at a compound annual rate of
5.1% or from $117 million in 1993 to $129 million in 1995.  Total therms
delivered increased from 809,348 thousand therms in 1993 to 886,729 thousand
therms in 1995, or at a compound annual rate of 4.7%.  Despite an annualized
$9 million or 3.3% rate increase that became effective September 2, 1993 and
the increased therm deliveries, Gas Operating Revenues declined due to a
reduction in the cost of gas which is passed through to customers via the
purchased gas adjustment clause.   Gross margin grew as a result of increased
therm sales to Residential and Commercial customers who contribute higher
margins to earnings than other customer classes.  Total therm deliveries
increased in part due to favorable weather conditions and moderate economic
growth in WE's service territory from 1993 through 1995.

From 1993 through 1995, therm sales to Residential and Commercial/Industrial
customers increased at compound annual rates of 3.5% and 1.2% or from 322,444
thousand and 202,549 thousand therms, respectively, in 1993 to 345,140
thousand and 207,358 thousand therms in 1995.  The average number of
Residential and Commercial/Industrial customers increased at compound annual
rates of 3.1% and 2.5%, respectively, during this period.  Therm deliveries to
Interruptible and to Transportation customers increased at compound annual
rates of 21.0% and 6.6% or from 34,608 thousand and 249,747 thousand therms,
respectively, in 1993 to 50,646 thousand and 283,585 thousand therms in 1995. 
These gas deliveries increased in part due to the increased electric
generation peaking requirements of Paris and Concord noted above.  Therms of
Transported Customer Owned Gas accounted for 32.0%, 29.7% and 30.9% of WE's
total therms delivered during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Operating Expenses

1995 Compared to 1994:  Excluding Depreciation expense, total operating income
taxes and the nonrecurring 1994 Revitalization charge, total Operating
Expenses decreased 0.9% in 1995, reflecting a reduction of approximately $16
million or 3.1% in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses attributable to
payroll-related savings and efficiencies gained through WE's Revitalization
program.  Such reductions were partially offset by higher costs related to
increased generation, the availability of Paris and unscheduled or longer than
expected outages at two of WE's most efficient power plants.

Fuel expense increased by approximately $18 million or 6.2% while Purchased
Power expense declined approximately $1 million or 1.9% in 1995.  Fuel expense
rose as a result of higher electric sales.  Purchased Power expense fell as a
result of decreased marginal generating costs at three of WE's fossil plants
and the newly installed peaking capacity at Paris.  Lower generating costs at
the fossil plants were due to decreased per unit fuel costs and the benefits
of Revitalization, allowing WE to substitute generation for power purchases. 
The addition of Paris in 1995 allowed WE to eliminate firm power purchase
contracts that contained fixed demand charges.  The unscheduled or

Operating Expenses - (cont'd)

longer than expected outages in 1995 noted above, however, offset most of the
decrease in Purchased Power expense as WE purchased nonfirm replacement energy
on the spot market.

Despite the increase in therm deliveries during 1995 noted above, Cost of Gas
Sold decreased by approximately $11 million or 5.4% in 1995 as a result of a
decrease in the average cost per therm sold.

From 1994 to 1995, total operating income taxes increased $41 million or 41.4%
due to lower taxable income in 1994 caused by the nonrecurring  Revitalization
charge.  Deferred Income Taxes - Net increased $22 million or 88.7% primarily
due to tax matters related to the timing of payments made in connection with
WE's Revitalization program.

1993 Through 1995:  Since 1993, total Operating Expenses excluding
Depreciation expense, total operating income taxes and the nonrecurring 1994
Revitalization charge have decreased at a compound annual rate of 2.1% or from
$1,088 million in 1993 to $1,042 million in 1995.  Other Operation and
Maintenance expenses decreased from $555 million in 1993 to approximately $508
million in 1995, a compound annual decrease of 4.4% largely due to the
Revitalization related work force reductions and efficiency gains referred to
above as well as to lower expenditures made in connection with power plant
renovation work as certain major maintenance programs were completed in 1994. 
These decreases have been partially offset by expenses associated with the
implementation of Revitalization and increases in conservation-related
expenses associated with improving the efficiency of customers' energy usage.

Fuel expense increased at a compound annual rate of 7.4% or from $263 million
in 1993 to approximately $304 million in 1995, primarily due to increased
electric sales.  Purchased Power expense decreased at a compound annual rate
of 12.7% or from $55 million in 1993 to approximately $42 million in 1995 due
to the decreased marginal generating costs at three of WE's fossil plants
noted above and to additional peak generating capacity placed in service at
Concord and Paris in 1994 and 1995, respectively.  A 6.1% compound annual
decrease in the Cost of Gas Sold from $214 million in 1993 to approximately
$189 million in 1995 is attributable to a decrease in the average cost per
therm sold.  Depreciation expense has increased at a compound annual rate of
4.9% from $167 million in 1993 to $184 million in 1995 as a result of higher
depreciable plant balances.  During this period, total operating income taxes
and Deferred Income Taxes-Net have been affected by tax matters related to
Revitalization as noted above and by a prior period reclassification between
current and deferred income taxes.

Other Items

Other Interest Charges increased by $5 million between 1995 and 1994 and by $5
million between 1994 and 1993, reflecting increased average short-term debt
balances, primarily at WE.

New Pronouncements:  In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets ("FAS 121") and Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation ("FAS 123").  FAS 121 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed

for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  FAS 123 establishes
reporting standards and an optional accounting method for stock-based employee
compensation plans.  The Company will adopt both standards prospectively in
1996.  It is anticipated that adoption will not have a material effect on the
Company's net income or financial position.

In February 1996, FASB released for comment an exposure draft of a Proposed
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS"), Accounting for Certain
Liabilities Related to Closure or Removal of Long-Lived Assets.  The proposed
FAS, if issued, would require WE to recognize as a liability the present value
of the estimated future total costs associated with closure or removal of
certain long-lived assets and to correspondingly capitalize those costs.  The
capitalized costs would be depreciated to expense over the useful life of the
asset.  The proposed statement would become effective in 1997.  This proposed
FAS would apply to decommissioning costs for Point Beach Nuclear Plant ("Point
Beach") and would result in WE recording a decommissioning liability and
corresponding asset as required by the pronouncement.  Currently, nuclear
decommissioning costs are accrued as depreciation expense over the expected
service lives of the two units at Point Beach based on an external sinking
fund method.  Any changes in depreciation expense due to differing assumptions
between the proposed FAS and those currently required by the PSCW are not
expected to be material and would most likely be deferrable and recoverable in
rates.  For additional information on the costs of decommissioning Point
Beach, see Note F - "Nuclear Operations" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

Effects of Inflation:  With expectations of low-to-moderate inflation, the
Company does not believe the impact of inflation will have a material effect
on its future results of operations.

Electric Sales and Gas Deliveries Outlook

Assuming moderate growth in the economy of its service territory and normal
weather, WE presently anticipates total electric kilowatt-hour sales to grow
at a compound annual rate of approximately 1.1% over the five-year period
ending December 31, 2000.  WE forecasts total therm deliveries of natural gas
to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 2.1% over the same five-
year period.  These forecasts are subject to a number of variables, including
among others the economy, weather and the restructuring of the electric and
gas utility industries,  which may affect the actual growth in sales.  These
estimates do not reflect the operations of NSP, which will become a part of
Primergy after consummation of the Transaction.  See "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -
Mergers" above.

Rates and Regulatory Matters

The table below summarizes the projected annual revenue impact of recent rate
changes authorized by regulatory commissions for the electric, natural gas and
steam utilities of the Company based on the sales projections utilized by
those commissions in setting rates.  The PSCW regulates Wisconsin retail
electric, steam and natural gas rates, while the FERC regulates wholesale
power and electric transmission and gas transportation service rates.  The
Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") regulates retail electric rates in
Michigan.  The PSCW has discontinued the practice of conducting annual rate

case proceedings, replacing it with a new schedule which calls for future rate
cases to be conducted once every two years.

In support of its goal to become the lowest-cost energy provider in the region
and in light of the operating cost reductions expected from the reengineering
process discussed above, WE did not seek an increase in rates for 1994 or
1995.

Under the Wisconsin retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure, retail
electric rates may be adjusted, on a prospective basis, if cumulative fuel and
purchased power costs, when compared to the costs projected in the retail
electric rate proceeding, deviate from a prescribed range and are expected to
continue to be above or below that range.  WE believes that it has the ability
to maintain low fuel costs through efficient management of its power supply
system and fuel procurement practices.  Therefore, WE has proposed the
elimination of the retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure in its 1997
Test Year filing with the PSCW.  On December 15, 1995, the MPSC approved the
suspension of the Power Supply Cost Recovery Clause (fuel adjustment
procedure) for a five-year period for Michigan retail electric customers.  In
the case of natural gas costs, differences between the test year estimate and
the actual cost of purchased gas are accounted for through a purchased gas
adjustment clause.

1996 Test Year:  In a letter order dated September 11, 1995, the PSCW directed
WE to implement rate decreases for Wisconsin retail electric, gas and steam
customers of $33.383 million or 2.75%, $8.298 million or 2.6% and $0.790
million or 5.1%, respectively, on an annualized basis effective January 1,
1996.  The decrease is based on a regulatory return on common equity of 11.3%,
down from 12.3% authorized since 1993.  Also effective January 1, 1996, the
MPSC authorized WE to implement a rate decrease for Michigan non-mine retail
electric customers of $1.128 million or 3.3% on an annualized basis.

1997 Test Year:  On January 16, 1996, WE filed specific financial data with
the PSCW related to the 1997 test year showing an $82.2 million revenue
deficiency for its utility operations.  The dollar impacts and percentage
increases requested for Wisconsin retail electric, gas and steam customers are
$77.0 million or 6.2%, $4.3 million or 1.4% and $0.9 million or 6.4%,
respectively, on an annualized basis.  On March 15, 1996, WE filed testimony
and exhibits with the PSCW related to the 1997 test year.  The PSCW had
determined that it required a special full review of WE's rates for the 1997
test year in connection with consideration of the application for approval of
the proposed merger of WEC and NSP.

Neither the 1996 nor 1997 Test Year changes reflect the proposed retail
electric and gas rate reductions and freezes nor the wholesale rate reductions
and freezes related to the proposed merger with NSP.  See "RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - Mergers" above for a separate discussion of rate actions related
to the proposed Transaction.

PSCW Electric Utility Industry Investigation:  The PSCW has conducted an
investigation into the electric utility industry in Wisconsin, particularly
its institutional structure and regulatory regime, in order to evaluate what
changes would be beneficial for Wisconsin.  The PSCW stated that this
investigation may result in profound and fundamental changes to the nature and
regulation of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin.  In January 1995,
the PSCW established an advisory committee, including WE, to examine all
aspects of the electric utility industry and to suggest which functions should
be performed in a competitive market.  The PSCW decided on December 12, 1995
the general direction of utility regulation in Wisconsin.  This proposed
restructuring of the industry would permit all consumers to choose their
electricity provider by the year 2001 and it would establish a competitive
generation business.  The transmission and distribution functions would remain
regulated.  In a February 22, 1996 Report to the Wisconsin Legislature, the
PSCW identified a 32 step workplan that it would follow for Electric Utility
Restructuring in Wisconsin.  In the plan, the PSCW indicated that during 1996
it will begin activities on 12 of these steps, some of which would seek
changes in applicable administrative rules under its jurisdiction, including
affiliated interest standards and quality of service standards.  The PSCW
expects to present an electric utility restructuring proposal to the Wisconsin
State Legislature in 1997.  In its February 22, 1996 report, the PSCW stated
that the implementation timetable for its plan is subject to change depending
on the pace of resolution of the specific restructuring steps and on external
events.

PSCW Natural Gas Utility Industry Investigation:  The PSCW also continued a
generic investigation of the natural gas industry in Wisconsin and addressed
the extent to which traditional regulation should be replaced with a different
approach.  In conjunction with this generic investigation, the PSCW staff is
reviewing the use of the current purchased gas adjustment ("PGA") mechanism
which is designed to pass on to gas customers increases or decreases in the
cost of natural gas purchased for resale.  A separate docket has been
established to review the PGA.  WE is participating in these PSCW
investigations.

In June 1995, WE filed with the PSCW a proposal to replace the current PGA
mechanism with a new market-based pricing mechanism.  The proposed gas pricing

mechanism would link gas commodity prices to market indices and incorporate
all other gas supply costs such as transportation and storage, under a price
cap.  The price cap would be designed to provide balanced financial incentives
and risks for WE based upon performance standards, while ensuring a reliable
gas supply for consumers.  In July 1995, the PSCW decided to analyze and
review this proposal as part of the generic docket established to review the
PGA.  The matter is pending.

FERC Open Access Transmission NOPR:  In March 1995, the FERC issued a Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission
Services by Public Utilities.  The NOPR's goal is to create a more competitive
wholesale electric power market.  In the proposed rulemaking, FERC would
require all electric utilities that own or control transmission facilities to
file non-discriminatory open access transmission tariffs available to
wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy, to take service under the
tariffs for their own wholesale sales and purchases of electric energy and to
provide utilities the opportunity to recover legitimate and verifiable
stranded costs on the federal and state levels.  WE advocates open access to
transmission facilities as a necessary step in the competitive restructuring
of the electric utility industry and does not believe that the issuance of a
final rule by FERC will have a negative material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.  WE expects FERC to finalize and
issue its open access transmission rules in the second quarter of 1996.

Regulatory Accounting:  WEC's principal subsidiary, WE, operates under
electric utility rates which are subject to the approval of the PSCW, MPSC and
FERC, and natural gas and steam utility rates that are subject to the approval
of the PSCW (see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" above).  Such rates are
designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to
investors.  Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may
result in future utility rates which are based upon factors other than the
traditional original cost of investment.  In such a situation, continued
deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utility's
books may no longer be appropriate as allowed under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.  At this time, WEC is unable to predict whether any adjustments to
regulatory assets and liabilities will occur in the future.  See Note A -
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Investing Activities

WEC invested $1.111 billion in its businesses during the three years ended
December 31, 1995.  The investments made during this three-year period include
construction expenditures for new or improved facilities totaling $932
million, purchases of nuclear fuel of $70 million, net capitalized
conservation expenditures of $54 million and payments to an external trust for
the eventual decommissioning of WE's Point Beach Nuclear Plant totaling $32
million.

Paris Generating Station:  During 1995, WE placed in service four units, or
approximately 300 megawatts of capacity, at its Paris Generating Station. 
This natural gas-fired combustion turbine facility, located near Union Grove,
Wisconsin, is designed to meet peak demand requirements.  Capital expenditures
of $10 million, $54 million and $28 million were made during 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively, for construction of this facility.  The capital costs of
the Paris facility will total approximately $105 million.

Concord Generating Station:  During 1994, WE placed in service the last two
units, or approximately 150 megawatts of capacity, at its Concord Generating
Station.  This four unit 300 megawatt natural gas-fired combustion turbine
facility, located near Watertown, Wisconsin, is designed to meet peak demand
requirements.  The first two units were completed in 1993.  Capital
expenditures of $3 million, $6 million and $35 million were made during 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively, for construction of this facility.  The capital
costs of the Concord facility will total approximately $107 million.

Port Washington Power Plant Renovation:  Additionally during 1994, WE
completed the $107 million renovation project at its Port Washington Power
Plant.  The renovation work, which began in September 1991, included the
installation of additional emission control equipment.  Expenditures totaling
$12 million and $36 million were made during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Cash Provided by Operating and Financing Activities

During the three years ended December 31, 1995, cash provided by operating
activities totaled $1.248 billion.  During this period, internal sources of
funds, after the payment of dividends, provided approximately 72% of the
Company's capital requirements.

Financing activities during the three-year period ended December 31, 1995
included the issuance of $646 million of long-term debt, principally to
refinance higher coupon debt, the addition of $164 million of common equity
from the issuance of new shares through the Company's stock plans and the
purchase or redemption of $71 million of preferred stock.  No preferred stock
was issued during this period.  Additionally, during the three-year period
ended December 31, 1995, the Company retired a total of $503 million of long-
term debt and increased short-term debt by $35 million.  Dividends on the
Company's common stock were $160 million, $151 million, and $141 million,
during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

In December 1995, WE issued $100 million of unsecured One Hundred Year 6 7/8%
Debentures due 2095.  Proceeds of the issue were added to WE's general funds
and were applied to the repayment of short-term borrowings.

In August 1995, WE called for optional redemption $98.35 million aggregate
principal amount of fixed rate tax exempt bonds issued by three political
jurisdictions on WE's behalf that were secured by issues of WE's First
Mortgage Bonds with terms corresponding to the tax exempt bonds called for
redemption.  During September and October 1995, the three political
jurisdictions issued $98.35 million aggregate principal amount of new tax
exempt bonds on behalf of WE, collateralized by unsecured variable rate
promissory notes issued by WE, maturing between March 1, 2006 and

September 1, 2030, with terms corresponding to the respective issues of the
refunding tax exempt bonds.  The proceeds were used to finance the optional
redemptions.  The WE First Mortgage Bonds, which collateralized the redeemed
tax exempt bonds, have been canceled.

During 1993, WE issued five new series of First Mortgage Bonds aggregating
$350 million in principal amount, the proceeds of which were used to redeem
$284.3 million principal amount of four outstanding series of First Mortgage
Bonds and 626,500 shares of WE's 6.75% Series Preferred Stock.  These
refunding transactions are expected to result in significant savings over the
lives of the new debt issues.  Depending on market conditions and other
factors, additional debt refundings may occur.

The Merger Agreement, entered into by WEC and NSP, provides for restrictions
on certain transactions by both the Company and NSP, including the issuance of
debt and equity securities.  While WEC does not currently plan to enter into
transactions that would not comply with these restrictions, circumstances may
arise to make such transactions necessary.  Under such circumstances, NSP
would need to agree to consent to any such change in the Merger Agreement.

See Note A - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for a discussion of various limitations on the ability of
the Company's utility subsidiary to transfer funds to WEC.

Capital Structure

The Company's capitalization at December 31 was as follows:

==============================================================================

Compared to the utility industry in general, the Company has maintained a
relatively high ratio of common equity to total capitalization and low debt
and preferred stock ratios.  This conservative capital structure, along with
strong bond ratings and internal cash generation has provided, and should
continue to provide, the Company with access to the capital markets when
necessary to finance the anticipated growth in the Company's utility business. 
WE currently has senior secured debt ratings of AA+ by Standard & Poor's
Corporation ("S&P"), Duff & Phelps Inc. and Fitch Investors Service Inc.
("Fitch") and Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's").

Following announcement of the Transaction, on May 1, 1995 S&P reported that it
was placing on CreditWatch with negative implications its AA+ senior secured
debt and AA+ preferred stock ratings of WE and its AA senior unsecured debt
rating of Wisconsin Michigan Investment Corporation, a non-utility subsidiary

of WEC.  S&P stated that if the Transaction is completed, the likely credit
rating for the senior secured debt of WE is expected to be AA or AA-.  As part
of its rating process, S&P intends to review the financial and operating plans
of the merged utilities.  Also on May 1, 1995, citing WE's continued operation
as a separate utility subsidiary after the Transaction, its strength within
its rating category and its strong capital structure, Moody's confirmed its
Aa2 first mortgage bond rating of WE. On December 5, 1995, Fitch changed WE's
credit trend from "stable" to "declining" based upon its analysis of cash flow
trends versus its standards for an AA+ rating.

At year-end 1995, WEC had $157 million of unused lines of bank credit and $24
million of cash and cash equivalents.

Capital Requirements 1996-2000

The estimated capital requirements for the Company's utility subsidiary for
the years 1996-2000 are outlined in the table below.  Compared to the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994, the
table below no longer reflects conservation expenditures.  Effective 
January 1, 1995, WE began expensing conservation expenditures currently. 
Through 1995, capitalized conservation investments were amortized to Operating
Expense over a ten-year amortization period.  Effective 
January 1, 1996, WE began amortizing the remaining capitalized conservation
investment to operating expense over a five-year amortization period.

The capital requirements table below does not reflect the impact of the
proposed Transaction with NSP.  See "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Mergers" above.

LS Power Generation Facility:  In 1993, a competitive bidding process
conducted by the PSCW resulted in the selection of a proposal submitted by an
unaffiliated independent power producer, LSP-Whitewater L.P. ("LS Power"), to
construct a generation facility to meet a portion of WE's anticipated increase
in system supply needs.  WE subsequently signed a long-term agreement to
purchase electricity from the proposed facility.  The agreement is contingent
upon the facility being completed and placed into operation, which at this
time is planned for mid-1997.

PSCW Advance Plan 7:  In January 1994, a coordinated state-wide plan for
meeting future electricity needs of Wisconsin customers was filed with the
PSCW in the Advance Plan 7 Docket.  In the Advance Plan process, WE, in
conjunction with the other regulated electric utilities located in Wisconsin,
files long-term forecasts of resource requirements, such as the need for
generation and transmission facilities, along with plans to meet those
requirements, including the use of energy management and conservation.  The
PSCW approved WE's Advance Plan 7 filing in December 1995.

In order to reliably meet its forecasted growth in demand, WE employs a least-
cost integrated planning process which includes renovation of existing power
plants, promotion of cost-effective conservation and load management options,
development of renewable energy sources, purchases of power and construction
of new company-owned generation facilities.

Investments in demand-side management programs have reduced and delayed the
need to add new generating capacity but have not eliminated the need entirely. 
Purchases of power from other utilities and transmission system upgrades will
also combine to help delay the need to install some new generating capacity in
the future.

Finally, WE's Advance Plan 7 filing indicated a need for additional peaking
capacity after the turn of the century, along with an anticipated need for
additional intermediate-load capacity during the 2000 to 2010 time period.  WE
does not anticipate needing additional base load generation until after 2010.

The addition of new generating units requires approval of the PSCW following a
two-stage bidding process, which could influence whether WE would construct
such facilities or purchase the required power.  The United States
Environmental Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources ("DNR") also must approve new generating units.  All generating
facilities proposed by WE will meet or exceed the applicable federal and state
environmental requirements.

Kimberly Cogeneration Facility:  Prior to the 1993 selection of the LS Power
generation facility by the PSCW, WE had proposed to construct its own 220
megawatt cogeneration facility in Kimberly, Wisconsin, which was intended to
provide process steam to Repap Wisconsin, Inc. ("Repap") starting in mid-1994. 
In the PSCW Order, the WE project was selected as the second place conditional
project if the LS Power project did not proceed.  WE had made expenditures for
the Kimberly facility of approximately $65.8 million associated with the
procurement of three combustion turbines, one steam turbine and three heat
recovery boilers in order to achieve the in-service dates as agreed to in a
steam service contract with Repap.

The Company is currently reviewing its options regarding its Kimberly
Cogeneration Facility equipment (the "Equipment").  The Equipment is of a
technology of natural gas-fired combined cycle generation equipment that is
marketed worldwide.  The Company is investigating opportunities to sell the
Equipment or to use it in another power project and is currently evaluating
potential sales opportunities and/or power projects involving the Equipment. 
At this time, the Company does not believe that disposition of the Equipment
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.  However,
there is a possibility that WE may need to recognize an impairment of the

Equipment in the future should the projects noted above not occur and should
no other viable sales opportunities and/or power projects involving the
Equipment be identified.

Point Beach Unit 2 Steam Generators and Dry Cask Storage Facility:  WE
operates two 500 megawatt generating units at Point Beach.  During 1995, Point
Beach accounted for 26.9% of WE's net electric generation.  The current
operating licenses for the two units at Point Beach expire in 2010 and 2013
for Units 1 and 2, respectively.

In October 1992, WE filed an application with the PSCW for replacement of the
Point Beach Unit 2 steam generators.  As a result of degradation of some of
the tubes within the Unit 2 steam generators, the unit has been operating at
approximately 90% of its capacity since its return to service after its annual
refueling outage in the fall of 1995.  In February 1995, the PSCW deferred a
decision on the replacement of the steam generators in part to gather more
information during the fall 1995 refueling outage.  An evaluation of
information gathered during this outage was included in a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement ("SEIS") prepared by the PSCW that shows the
replacement of the Unit 2 steam generators to be the most cost-effective
option when compared to all credible alternatives.  Considering the rate of
tube degradation in the steam generators, there is a likelihood that WE would
not be able to restart Unit 2 following the fall 1996 outage without
replacement of the steam generators.  In its SEIS, the PSCW estimates that
failure to replace the Unit 2 steam generators would cost WE customers up to
$494 million over the next 25 years to replace lost generation when compared
to the current estimated cost of replacement of $96 million.

In a related matter, WE received a Certificate of Authority from the PSCW in
February 1995 to construct and operate an Independent Spent Fuel Storage
Installation ("ISFSI").  The ISFSI will provide interim dry cask storage of
spent fuel from Point Beach using a system that was certified by the NRC after
a four-year technical review.  Construction was completed in June 1995 with
associated capital costs of $8.5 million.  WE loaded the first cask with spent
fuel in December 1995.  On December 22, 1995, the Dane County Circuit Court
("Court") issued a decision vacating and remanding the February 1995 order of
the PSCW on procedural grounds, stating that the Environmental Impact
Statement prepared by the PSCW for this project was inadequate in two
respects.  Transfer of additional spent fuel to the ISFSI has been temporarily
suspended by WE pending the PSCW's further action.

The PSCW has issued two SEIS's which address steam generator issues and the
inadequacies found by the Court with the original Environmental Impact
Statement for the ISFSI project.  The PSCW held related hearings on these
matters in February and March 1996.  WE anticipates that the PSCW will issue a
combined final order on replacement of the Unit 2 steam generators and the
remanded dry cask storage matters in May 1996.  Failure by the PSCW to approve
the steam generator replacement and resolve the remanded issues could
jeopardize the continued operation of Point Beach and materially affect WE's
financial position and results of operations.  WE would likely seek regulatory
relief to minimize the replacement power costs resulting from lost generating
capacity.

             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (cont'd)

Capital Requirements 1996-2000 - (cont'd)

The ISFSI was necessary because the spent fuel pool inside the plant is 
nearly full.  The dry storage facility will be used until the United States
Department of Energy ("DOE") takes ownership of and removes the spent fuel. 
While WE as well as other operators of nuclear power facilities in the United
States have a contract mandated by federal law that calls for the DOE to begin
accepting fuel in 1998, the DOE is not in a position to meet its commitment. 
If this commitment is not met, WE will need to construct additional casks and
will seek PSCW approval to do so.

Milwaukee County Power Plant:  In December 1995, WE signed an agreement with
Milwaukee County to purchase the Milwaukee County Power Plant located in
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  The 11 megawatt power plant provides steam, chilled
water and electricity for the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and several
other large customers located on the Milwaukee County grounds.  WE had
previously obtained approval from the PSCW for the purchase of the electric
generation and distribution facilities and acquired them in December 1995 with
a capital expenditure of $7 million.  WE will integrate the electric
facilities into its current electric utility operations.  In February 1996, WE
filed an application with the PSCW for a Certificate of Authority to acquire
and place in operation the steam production and distribution facilities. 
Capital costs for the steam facilities will be $20 million.  WE anticipates
PSCW approval of the acquisition by mid-1996 and will integrate the steam
facilities into its current steam utility operations.  WEC will acquire and
operate the chilled water facility as a non-regulated business.  The chilled
water production and distribution facility will be acquired with a capital
cost of $18 million in conjunction with the steam facility acquisition
anticipated in mid-1996.  Purchase of the steam and chilled water portions of
the plant is contingent upon PSCW approval to acquire the steam facilities and
upon the five major customers signing ten-year steam and chilled water service
agreements.

Capital Resources

During the five-year period ending December 31, 2000, WE expects internal
sources of funds from operations, after dividends to WEC, to provide about 87%
of the utility capital requirements.  The remaining utility cash requirements
are expected to be met through short-term borrowings and the issuance of
intermediate or long-term debt.  The specific form, amount and timing of debt
securities which may be issued have not yet been determined and will depend,
to a large extent, on market conditions and other factors.  The anticipated
capital resources during this period do not reflect the impact of the proposed
merger with NSP.  See "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Mergers" above.

On June 1, 1992, WEC began issuing new shares of common stock through the
Company's stock plans.  Previously, WEC had purchased shares required for the
plans on the open market.  Cash investments and reinvested dividends
aggregating $52.4 million were used to purchase 1,879,568 new issue shares
during 1995.  Effective January 1, 1996, WEC resumed purchasing shares
required for the plans on the open market.

Environmental Issues

Clean Air Act:  The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act mandate significant
nation-wide reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions to address acid rain and
ground level ozone control requirements.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (cont'd)

Environmental Issues - (cont'd)

In 1994, WE completed the installation of continuous emission monitors at all
of its facilities and installed low NOx burners on one boiler at its Oak Creek
Power Plant and two boilers at its Valley Power Plant.  These actions, along
with the burning of low sulfur coal and the installation of low NOx burners on
other boilers at Oak Creek and Valley Power Plants in early 1995, meet the
requirements that became effective January 1, 1995.  To date, approximately
$45.3 million has been spent on compliance with the 1990 amendments to the
Clean Air Act.

WE elected to voluntarily bring the Valley and Port Washington Power Plants
under jurisdiction of the NOx and SO2 requirements of the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990, five years earlier than mandated.  This was possible
because these units meet the more stringent phase II emissions standards
today.

WE projects a surplus of SO2 emission allowances and is seeking additional
allowances available as a result of energy conservation programs.  As an
integral component of its least-cost plan, WE is active in SO2 allowance
trading.  Revenue from the sale of allowances is being used to offset future
potential rate increases.

Additional fuel switching and the installation of NOx controls at various
power plants will be required to meet the second phase of reduction
requirements that become effective January 1, 2000.  These costs, along with
additional operating expenses, are not expected to exceed $40.3 million based
on today's costs.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:  WE's natural gas business unit is investigating
the remediation of a number of former manufactured gas plant ("MGP") sites. 
Operations at these MGP sites ceased over 40 years ago.  Limited remediation
activities occurred at a number of these sites during the 1980's, with removal
of waste materials known to be present at that time.  In 1995, WE presented a
plan to investigate and further remediate sites to the DNR.  During 1995, WE
conducted site investigations at four sites and partial remediation activities
were conducted at one site.  Approximately $1.6 million has been spent through
December 31, 1995 for such activities.  Remediation costs to be incurred
through the year 2000 have been estimated to be $12 million, but the total
costs are uncertain pending the results of further site specific
investigations and the selection of site specific remedial actions.  In its
September 11, 1995 letter order, the PSCW allowed WE to defer MGP site
remediation costs with final rate treatment of such costs to be determined in
future rate cases.  As of December 31, 1995, WE has recorded an accrued
liability of $1.6 million for MGP site remediation and a related deferred
regulatory asset of $3.2 million.  WE expects to accrue additional MGP site
remediation liabilities during 1996 as site specific investigations are
completed and site specific remedial actions are identified.  WE will seek
rate recovery for these costs and does not anticipate that there will be a
material adverse effect on its net income or financial position.

Ash Landfill Sites:  WE aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable,
beneficial uses of its combustion byproducts.  However, ash materials have
been, and to some degree, continue to be disposed in company-owned, licensed
landfills.  Some early designed and constructed landfills may allow the
release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels

of remediation.  Where WE has become aware of these conditions, efforts have
been expended to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has
been performed to address these conditions.  These costs are included in the
environmental operating and maintenance costs of WE.

Non-Utility Investments

WEC's non-utility assets amounted to approximately $242 million at December
31, 1995.  WEC currently anticipates making additional non-utility investments
from time to time.  For additional information, see Note L - "Information by
Segments of Business" in the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

Minergy Glass Aggregate Plant:  Minergy Corp. ("Minergy"), a non-regulated WEC
subsidiary, plans to place into operation in 1997 a $45 million facility in
Neenah, Wisconsin that would recycle paper sludge from area paper mills into
two usable products: glass aggregate and steam.  The glass aggregate will be
sold into existing construction and aggregate markets and the steam will be
sold to a local paper mill.  The plant will result in substantial
environmental and economic benefits to the area by providing an alternative to
landfilling paper sludge.  Minergy has received the necessary approvals from
the City of Neenah for construction of the facility and is awaiting the
issuance of necessary permits by the DNR.  The project is expected to be
financed during construction through short-term borrowings.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General:  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("WEC" or the "Company"), its utility subsidiary,
Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("WE"), and its non-utility subsidiaries,
Wisconsin Michigan Investment Corporation, Badger Service Company, Wispark
Corporation, Wisvest Corporation, Witech Corporation and other non-utility
companies.

The accounting records of the Company's utility subsidiary are kept as
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), modified for
requirements of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW").

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues:  Utility revenues are recognized on the accrual basis and include
estimated amounts for service rendered but not billed.

Fuel:  The cost of fuel is expensed in the period consumed.

Property:  Property is recorded at cost.  Additions to and significant
replacements of utility property are charged to utility plant at cost; minor
items are charged to maintenance expense.  Cost includes material, labor and
allowance for funds used during construction (see Note E).  The cost of
depreciable utility property, together with removal cost less salvage, is
charged to accumulated provision for depreciation when property is retired.

Deferred Regulatory Assets and Liabilities:  Pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation, WE capitalizes, as deferred regulatory assets, incurred
costs which are expected to be recovered in future utility rates.  WE also
records, as deferred regulatory liabilities, the current recovery in utility
rates of costs which are expected to be paid in the future.  A significant
portion of WE's deferred regulatory assets and liabilities relate to the
amounts recorded due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FAS 109").  (See Note D.)

Statement of Cash Flows:  Cash and cash equivalents include marketable debt
securities acquired three months or less from maturity. 

Conservation Investments:  WE directs a variety of demand-side management
programs to help foster energy conservation by its customers.  As authorized
by the PSCW, WE capitalized certain conservation program costs prior to 1995. 
Utility rates approved by the PSCW provide for a current return on these
conservation investments.  Through 1995, conservation investments were charged
to operating expense over a ten-year amortization period.  Beginning in 1996,
the capitalized conservation balance will be charged to operating expense on a
straight line basis over a five-year amortization period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (cont'd)

A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (cont'd)

Restrictions:  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements
impose certain restrictions on the ability of WEC's utility subsidiary to
transfer funds to WEC in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.  Under
Wisconsin law, WE is prohibited from loaning funds, either directly or
indirectly, to WEC.  The Company does not believe that such restrictions will
affect its operations.

New Pronouncements:  In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets ("FAS 121") and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("FAS
123").  FAS 121 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable.  FAS 123 established reporting standards
and an optional accounting method for stock-based employee compensation plans. 
The Company will adopt both standards prospectively in 1996.  It is
anticipated that adoption will not have a material effect on net income or
financial position.


B - Mergers

Wisconsin Natural Gas Company:  Effective January 1, 1996, the Company merged
its natural gas utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Natural Gas Company ("WN") into
WE.  The accounting treatment for this merger was similar to that which would
result from a pooling of interests.  Where applicable, references herein to WE
include WN prior to their merger.

Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc.:  Effective January 1, 1994, WEC acquired
all of the outstanding common stock of Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc.
("WSG") through a statutory merger of WSG into WN in which all of WSG's common
stock was converted into common stock of WEC.  WSG was a gas utility engaged
in the purchase, distribution, transportation and sale of natural gas
primarily in a section of southeastern Wisconsin which was contiguous to WN's
service territory.  WSG was merged into WN using the pooling of interests
method of accounting.  Accordingly, prior years' financial and statistical
information was restated to include WSG at historical values.

Northern States Power Company:  On April 28, 1995, WEC and Northern States
Power Company, a Minnesota corporation ("NSP"), entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, which was amended and restated as of July 26, 1995 ("Merger
Agreement").  The Merger Agreement provides for a strategic business
combination involving WEC and NSP in a "merger-of-equals" transaction
("Transaction").  As a result, WEC will become a registered public utility
holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, and will change its name to Primergy Corporation ("Primergy"). 
Primergy will be the parent company of WE (which will be renamed Wisconsin
Energy Company), of NSP (which, for regulatory reasons, will reincorporate in
Wisconsin ("New NSP")), and of the other subsidiaries of WEC and NSP.  The
Transaction is intended to be tax-free for income tax purposes and to be
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  On September 13, 1995, stockholders
of WEC and NSP voted to approve the Transaction.  The Merger Agreement is
subject to various conditions, including the approval of various regulatory
agencies.  Subject to obtaining all requisite approvals, WEC and NSP
anticipate completing the Transaction by January 1, 1997.

B - Mergers - (cont'd)

In connection with the Transaction, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin
corporation ("NSP-WI"), currently a subsidiary of NSP, will be merged into 
Wisconsin Energy Company.  Prior to the merger of NSP-WI into Wisconsin Energy
Company, New NSP will acquire from NSP-WI certain gas utility assets in
LaCrosse and Hudson, Wisconsin.

The following summarized Primergy unaudited pro forma financial information
combines historical balance sheet and income statement information of WEC and
NSP to give effect to the Transaction and should be read in conjunction with
the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of
WEC and NSP.  A $141 million pro forma adjustment has been made to conform the
presentation of noncurrent deferred income taxes in the summarized unaudited
pro forma combined balance sheet information as a net liability.  The
allocation between WEC and NSP and their customers of the estimated cost

C - Depreciation

Depreciation expense is accrued at straight line rates over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.  These rates are certified by the PSCW and include
estimates for salvage and removal costs.  Depreciation as a percent of average
depreciable utility plant was 3.8% in 1995 and 3.9% in 1994 and 1993.  Nuclear
plant decommissioning is accrued as depreciation expense (see Note F).


D - Income Taxes

Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation is used for federal and state
temporary differences.  The federal investment tax credit is accounted for on
the deferred basis and is reflected in income ratably over the life of the
related property.

==============================================================================


E - Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC")

AFUDC is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of
borrowed funds used during plant construction and a return on stockholders'
capital used for construction purposes.  Allowance for borrowed funds also
includes interest capitalized on qualifying assets of non-utility
subsidiaries.  On the income statement, the cost of borrowed funds (before
income taxes) is a reduction of interest expense and the return on
stockholders' capital is an item of noncash other income.

Utility rates approved by the PSCW provide for a current return on investment
for selected long-term projects included in construction work in progress
("CWIP").  AFUDC was capitalized on the remaining CWIP at a rate of 10.83% in
1995, 1994 and 1993, as approved by the PSCW.


F - Nuclear Operations

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:  WE operates two 500 megawatt generating units at
its Point Beach Nuclear Plant ("Point Beach").  During 1995, Point Beach
accounted for 26.9% of WE's net electric generation.  The current operating
licenses for the two units at Point Beach expire in 2010 and 2013 for Units 1
and 2, respectively.

WE has filed an application with the PSCW for replacement of the Point Beach
Unit 2 steam generators.  As a result of degradation of some of the tubes
within the Unit 2 steam generators, the unit has been operating at
approximately 90% of its capacity since its return to service after its annual
refueling outage in the fall of 1995.  Considering the rate of tube
degradation in the steam generators, there is a likelihood that WE would not
be able to restart Unit 2 following the fall 1996 outage without replacement
of the steam generators.

In a related matter, WE completed construction of an Independent Spent Fuel
Storage Installation ("ISFSI") in June 1995.  The ISFSI will provide interim
dry cask storage of spent fuel from Point Beach, which is necessary because
the spent fuel pool inside the plant is nearly full.  WE loaded the first cask
with spent fuel in December 1995.  On December 22, 1995, the Dane County
Circuit Court ("Court") issued a decision vacating and remanding the February
1995 PSCW approval of the ISFSI on procedural grounds, stating that the
Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the PSCW for this project was
inadequate in two respects.  Transfer of additional spent fuel to the ISFSI
has been temporarily suspended by WE pending the PSCW's further action.

The PSCW has issued two Supplemental Environmental Impact Statements which
address steam generator issues and the inadequacies found by the Court with
the original Environmental Impact Statement for the ISFSI project.  The PSCW
held related hearings on these matters in February and March 1996.  WE
anticipates that the PSCW will issue a combined final order on the replacement
of the Unit 2 steam generators and the remanded dry cask storage matters in
May 1996.  Failure by the PSCW to approve steam generator replacement and
resolve the remanded issues could jeopardize the continued operation of Point
Beach and materially affect WE's financial position and results of operations. 
WE would likely seek regulatory relief to minimize the replacement power costs
resulting from lost generating capacity.

Nuclear Fuel:  WE has a nuclear fuel leasing arrangement with Wisconsin
Electric Fuel Trust ("Trust"), which is treated as a capital lease.  The
nuclear fuel is leased for a period of 60 months or until the removal of the
fuel from the reactor, if earlier.  Lease payments include charges for the
cost of fuel burned, financing costs and a management fee.  In the event WE or
the Trust terminates the lease, the Trust would recover its unamortized cost
of nuclear fuel from WE.  Under the lease terms, WE is in effect the ultimate
guarantor of the Trust's commercial paper and line of credit borrowings
financing the investment in nuclear fuel.

Provided below is a summary of nuclear fuel investment at December 31 and
interest expense for the respective years on the nuclear fuel lease:

==============================================================================

The estimated cost of disposal of spent fuel based on a contract with the U.S.
Department of Energy ("DOE") is included in nuclear fuel expense.  The Energy
Policy Act of 1992 establishes a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund ("D&D Fund") for the DOE's nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities.  Deposits to the D&D Fund are derived in part from special
assessments to utilities.  As of December 31, 1995, WE has on its books a
remaining estimated liability equal to the projected special assessments of
$29.5 million.  A corresponding deferred regulatory asset will be amortized to
nuclear fuel expense and included in utility rates over the next 12 years.

Nuclear Insurance:  The Price-Anderson Act ("Act") provides an aggregate
limitation of $8.9 billion on public liability claims arising out of a nuclear
incident.  WE has $200 million of liability insurance from commercial sources. 
The Act also establishes an industry-wide retrospective rating plan under
which nuclear reactor owners could be assessed up to $79 million per reactor
(WE owns two), but not more than $10 million in any one year for each reactor,
in the event of a nuclear incident.

An industry-wide insurance program, with an aggregate limit of $200 million,
has been established to cover radiation injury claims of nuclear workers first
employed after 1987.  If claims in excess of the available funds develop, WE
could be assessed a maximum of approximately $3.0 million per reactor.

WE has property damage, decontamination and decommissioning insurance totaling
$1.5 billion for loss from damage at Point Beach with Nuclear Mutual Limited
("NML") and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ("NEIL").  Under the NML and
NEIL policies, WE has a potential maximum retrospective premium liability per
loss of $5.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

WE also maintains additional insurance with NEIL covering extra expenses of
obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage (in excess of
21 weeks) at Point Beach.  This insurance coverage provides weekly indemnities
of $3.5 million per unit for outages during the first year, declining to 80%
of the amounts during the second and third years.  Under the policy, WE's
maximum retrospective premium liability is approximately $7.7 million.

It should not be assumed that, in the event of a major nuclear incident, any
insurance or statutory limitation of liability would protect WE from material
adverse impact.

F - Nuclear Operations - (cont'd)

Nuclear Decommissioning:  Subject to approval by the PSCW of the Point Beach
Unit 2 steam generator replacements and resolution of the remanded ISFSI
matters described above, WE expects to operate the two units at Point Beach to
the expiration of their current operating licenses.  The estimated cost to
decommission the plant in 1995 dollars is $356 million based upon a site
specific decommissioning cost study completed in 1994.  Assuming plant
shutdown at the expiration of the current operating licenses, prompt
dismantlement and annual escalation of costs at specific inflation factors
established by the PSCW, it is projected that approximately $1.6 billion will
be spent over a twenty-year period, beginning in 2010, to decommission the
plant.

Nuclear decommissioning costs are accrued as depreciation expense over the
expected service lives of the two units based upon an external sinking fund
method.  In 1996, WE has increased its funding levels based on a site specific
estimate as required by the PSCW.  It is expected that the annual payments to
the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund ("Fund") along with the earnings on the
Fund will provide sufficient funds at the time of decommissioning.  WE
believes it is probable that any shortfall in funding would be recoverable in
utility rates.

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ("FAS 115"), WE's debt
and equity security investments in the Fund are classified as available for
sale.  Gains and losses on the Fund were determined on the basis of specific
identification; net unrealized holding gains on the Fund were recorded as part
of accumulated provision for depreciation.

H - Long-Term Debt

The maturities and sinking fund requirements through 2000 for the aggregate
amount of long-term debt outstanding (excluding obligations under capital
lease, see Note F) at December 31, 1995 are shown below:

==============================================================================

Sinking fund requirements for the years 1996 through 2000, included in the
table above, are $5.4 million.  Substantially all utility plant is subject to
the applicable mortgage.

Long-term debt premium or discount and expense of issuance are amortized by
the straight line method over the lives of the debt issues and included as
interest expense.  Unamortized amounts pertaining to reacquired debt are
written off currently, when acquired for sinking fund purposes, or amortized
in accordance with PSCW orders, when acquired for early retirement.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt was $1.5 billion and $1.2
billion at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The fair value of WE's
first mortgage bonds and debentures is estimated based upon the market value
of the same or similar issues.  Book value approximates fair value for the
Company's unsecured notes.  The fair value of WE's obligations under capital
lease is the market value of the Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust's commercial
paper.

In September and October 1995, WE issued $98.35 million of unsecured variable
rate promissory notes maturing between March 1, 2006 and September 1, 2030. 
These notes were issued as a revenue and collateral source for an equal
principal amount of tax exempt Refunding Revenue Bonds issued on WE's behalf
to refund $98.35 million of previously issued tax exempt bonds called for
optional redemption that were secured by WE's First Mortgage Bonds.

In December 1995, WE issued $100 million of unsecured One Hundred Year 6 7/8%
Debentures due 2095.  Proceeds of the issue were added to WE's general funds
and were applied to the repayment of short-term borrowings.

Unused lines of credit for short-term borrowing amounted to $157.4 million at
December 31, 1995.  In support of various informal lines of credit from banks,
WEC subsidiaries have agreed to maintain unrestricted compensating balances or
to pay commitment fees; neither the compensating balances nor the commitment
fees are significant.


J - Pension Plans

Effective in 1993, the PSCW adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions ("FAS 87"), for
ratemaking.

WE has several defined benefit noncontributory pension plans covering all
eligible employees.  Pension benefits are based on years of service and the
employee's compensation.  The majority of the plans' assets are equity
securities; other assets include corporate and government bonds and real
estate.  The plans are funded to meet the requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  

In the opinion of the Company, current pension trust assets and amounts which
are expected to be paid to the trusts in the future will be adequate to meet
future pension payment obligations to current and future retirees.

K - Benefits Other Than Pensions

Postretirement Benefits:  Effective in 1993, the Company adopted prospectively
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions ("FAS 106") and elected the 20
year option for amortization of the previously unrecognized accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation.  The PSCW has issued an order recognizing
FAS 106 for ratemaking; therefore adoption has no material impact on net
income.

K - Benefits Other Than Pensions - (cont'd)

WE sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans that cover both salaried and
nonsalaried employees who retire at age 55 or older with at least 10 years of
credited service.  The postretirement medical plan provides coverage to
retirees and their dependents.  Retirees contribute to the medical plan.  The
group life insurance benefit is based on employee compensation and is reduced
upon retirement.

Employees' Benefit Trusts ("Trusts") are used to fund a major portion of
postretirement benefits.  The funding policy for the Trusts is to maximize tax
deductibility.  The majority of the Trusts' assets are mutual funds.

==============================================================================

Changes in health care cost trend rates will affect the amounts reported.  For
example, a 1% increase in rates would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995 by $9.5 million and the aggregate
of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for the year then ended by $1 million.

Revitalization:  In the first quarter of 1994, WE recorded a $73.9 million
charge related to its revitalization program.  This charge included $37.5
million for Early Retirement Incentive Packages ("ERIP") and $25 million for
Severance Packages ("SP").  These plans were used to reduce employee staffing
levels.  ERIP provided for a monthly income supplement ("ERIP supplement"),
medical benefits and waiver of an early retirement pension reduction.  The SP
included a severance payment, medical/dental insurance, outplacement services,
personal financial planning and tuition support.  Availability of these plans
to various bargaining units was based upon agreements made between WE and the
bargaining units.  These plans were available to most management employees but
not to elected officers.

Under ERIP, 403 employees elected to retire in 1994.  Under SP, 651 and 75
employees enrolled in 1994 and 1995, respectively.  ERIP supplement costs are
paid from pension plan trusts and medical/dental benefits from employee
benefit trusts.  Remaining ERIP and SP costs are paid from general corporate
funds.  The ultimate timing of cash flows for ERIP supplement costs depends
upon the funding limitations of WE's pension plans.  With the exception of
ERIP supplement costs, approximately $35.4 million have been paid against the
revitalization liability through December 31, 1995, and a liability of $0.9
million remains outstanding at December 31, 1995.

Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan:  A stockholder approved Omnibus Stock Incentive
Plan ("Plan") enables the Company to provide a long-term incentive, through
equity interests in WEC, to selected officers and key employees.  The Plan
provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights
("SARS"), stock awards and performance units over a period of no more than ten
years.  Awards under the Plan may be paid in common stock, cash or a
combination thereof.  Four million shares of common stock have been reserved
under the Plan.  The exercise price of a stock option will not be less than
100% of the common stock's fair market value on the grant date and options may
not be exercised within six months of the grant date.

As of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, options for 335,500, 145,500 and
64,250 shares, respectively, were outstanding.  These options are exercisable
four years after the grant date at per share prices of between $26.813 and
$30.188.  Each stock option includes performance units based on contingent
dividends for four years from the date of grant.  Payment of these dividends
depends on the achievement of certain performance goals.  The earliest year in
which any of the options can be exercised is 1997.  No SARS or stock awards
have been granted and no performance units have been earned to date.

M - Commitments and Contingencies

Kimberly Cogeneration Facility:  In 1993, a competitive bidding process
conducted by the PSCW resulted in selection of a proposal submitted by an
unaffiliated independent power producer, LSP-Whitewater L.P. ("LS Power"), to
construct a generation facility to meet a portion of WE's anticipated increase
in system supply needs.  WE subsequently signed a long-term agreement to
purchase electricity from the proposed facility.  The agreement is contingent
upon the facility being completed and going into operation, which at this time
is planned for mid-1997.

Prior to the 1993 selection of the LS Power generation facility by the PSCW,
WE had proposed to construct its own 220 megawatt cogeneration facility in
Kimberly, Wisconsin, which was intended to provide process steam to Repap
Wisconsin, Inc. ("Repap") starting in mid-1994.  In the PSCW Order, the WE
project was selected as the second place conditional project if the LS Power
project did not proceed.  WE had made expenditures for the Kimberly facility
of approximately $65.8 million associated with the procurement of three
combustion turbines, one steam turbine and three heat recovery boilers in
order to achieve the in-service dates as agreed to in a steam service contract
with Repap.

The Company is currently reviewing other options for use or sale of its
Kimberly Cogeneration Facility equipment (the "Equipment").  The Equipment is
of a technology of natural gas-fired combined cycle generation equipment that
is marketed worldwide.  The Company is investigating opportunities to sell the
Equipment or to use it in another power project and is currently evaluating
potential sales opportunities and/or power projects involving the Equipment. 
At this time, the Company does not believe that disposition of the Equipment
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.  However,

there is a possibility that WE may need to recognize an impairment of the
Equipment in the future should the projects noted above not occur and should
no other viable sales opportunities and/or power projects involving the
Equipment be identified.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:  WE's natural gas business unit is investigating
the remediation of a number of former manufactured gas plant ("MGP") sites. 
Operations at these MGP sites ceased over 40 years ago.  Limited remediation
activities occurred at a number of these sites during the 1980's, with removal
of waste materials known to be present at that time.  In 1995, WE presented a
plan to investigate and remediate sites to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources ("DNR").  During 1995, WE conducted site investigations at four
sites and partial remediation activities were conducted at one site. 
Approximately $1.6 million has been spent through December 31, 1995 for such
activities.  Remediation costs to be incurred through the year 2000 have been
estimated to be $12 million, but the total costs are uncertain pending the
results of further site specific investigations and the selection of site
specific remedial actions.  In a September 11, 1995 letter order, the PSCW
allowed WE to defer MGP site remediation costs with final rate treatment of
such costs to be determined in future rate cases.  As of December 31, 1995, WE
has recorded an accrued liability of $1.6 million for MGP site remediation and
a related deferred regulatory asset of $3.2 million.  WE expects to accrue
additional MGP site remediation liabilities during 1996 as site specific
investigations are completed and site specific remedial actions are
identified.  WE will seek rate recovery for these costs and does not
anticipate that there will be a material adverse effect on its net income or
financial position.

Plans for the construction and financing of future additions to utility plant
can be found elsewhere in this report in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES - Capital Requirements 1996-2000."

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and
  the Stockholders of Wisconsin Energy Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed under Item
14(a)(1) and (2) appearing on page 86 of this report present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

PRIMERGY CORPORATION

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On April 28, 1995, Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("WEC") entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger with Northern States Power Company ("NSP"), which
was amended and restated as of July 26, 1995 (the "Merger Agreement").  The
Merger Agreement provides for a strategic business combination involving the
two companies in a "merger-of-equals" transaction (the "Transaction"), as
previously reported in WEC's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated as of April 28,
1995 and as of September 13, 1995 and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
for the quarters ended March 31, 1995, June 30, 1995 and September 30, 1995
("WEC's 3/31/95, 6/30/95 and 9/30/95 10-Q's").  Detailed information with
respect to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Transaction is contained in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus dated August 7, 1995 (contained in WEC's
Registration Statement on Form S-4, Registration No. 33-61619) relating to the
meetings of the stockholders of WEC and NSP to vote on the Merger Agreement
and related matters.

Further information concerning the Merger Agreement and the proposed
Transaction is included in Item 1. BUSINESS - "MERGER AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN
STATES POWER COMPANY", in Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND
RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS - "DIVIDEND POLICY OF PRIMERGY", in Item 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Mergers" and in Note B - "Mergers" in
the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA in this report.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information combines the
historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of WEC and NSP
after giving effect to the proposed Transaction to form Primergy Corporation
("Primergy").  The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet
information at December 31, 1995 gives effect to the Transaction as if it had
occurred at December 31, 1995.  The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 give effect to the Transaction as if it had occurred at
January 1, 1993.  This financial information is prepared on the basis of
accounting for the Transaction as a pooling of interests.  

The following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared
from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto of WEC and NSP.  The following
information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the Transaction been
consummated on the date, or at the beginning of the period for which the
Transaction is being given effect nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial position.

                             PRIMERGY CORPORATION

     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1. The pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect the
   conversion of each share of NSP Common Stock ($2.50 par value) outstanding
   into 1.626 shares of Primergy Common Stock ($.01 par value) and the
   continuation of each share of WEC Common Stock ($.01 par value)
   outstanding as one share of Primergy Common Stock, as provided in the
   Merger Agreement.  The pro forma combined condensed financial statements
   are presented as if the companies were combined during all periods
   included therein.

2. The allocation between NSP and WEC and their customers of the estimated
   cost savings resulting from the Transaction, net of the costs incurred to
   achieve such savings, will be subject to regulatory review and approval. 
   Cost savings resulting from the Transaction are estimated to be
   approximately $2 billion over a 10-year period, net of transaction costs 
   (including fees for financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
   consultants, filings and printing) and costs to achieve the savings of
   approximately $30 million and $122 million, respectively.  None of these
   estimated cost savings, the costs to achieve such savings, or the
   transaction costs have been reflected in the pro forma combined condensed
   financial statements. 

3. Intercompany transactions (including purchased and exchanged power
   transactions) between NSP and WEC during the periods presented were not
   material and, accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were made to 
   eliminate such transactions.

4. A pro forma adjustment has been made to conform the presentation of 
   noncurrent deferred income taxes in the pro forma combined condensed 
   balance sheet into one net amount.  All other financial statement
   presentation and accounting policy differences are immaterial and have not
   been adjusted in the pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

5. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1993 NSP
   financial statements to conform with the 1995 presentation.  These
   reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share.

                         WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION
                         ----------------------------

                    SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
                    --------------------------------------

This plan, which is retitled the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, succeeds to and constitutes an amendment and
restatement of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan; such amendment and restatement was effective as of
January 1, 1994; it was subsequently amended effective April 26, 1995.  All
the provisions of this amended and restated Plan, as subsequently amended,
shall apply to all Participants, active and retired, except for
Nancy R. Noeske and except as otherwise specifically provided herein.  The
rights of Ms. Noeske shall be as defined in the Wisconsin Energy Corporation
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan as restated and effective as of
January 1, 1989 (including amendments made in February of 1990 which became
effective as of January 1, 1989) and as defined in that certain Special
Employment, Retirement and Release Agreement made between Wisconsin Electric
Power Company and Ms. Noeske in 1993.
1.    Purpose.  The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") is
      maintained by Wisconsin Energy Corporation (the "Company") for the
      purpose of providing supplemental retirement benefits for a select group
      of management or highly compensated employees (key employees) within the
      meaning of Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
      The objective of the Plan is to provide an incentive for key employees
      to remain in the service of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and/or its
      subsidiaries by providing them with supplemental retirement benefits
      which are payable, except for the change in control provisions hereafter
      set forth, only if they remain in the service of Wisconsin Energy
      Corporation and/or its subsidiaries until they die or retire.
<PAGE> 3
2.    Participation.
      (A)   Definition of a "Participant".
            The term "Participant" as used herein refers to any key employee
            of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries who shall have
            automatically or by designation become subject to this Plan and
            who has not been removed from the Plan pursuant to (D) herein.

      (B)   Key Employees Presently Party to the Plan.
            Any key employee who was a party to this Plan before
            January 1, 1989, (this Plan being designated the Wisconsin Energy
            Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan), shall
            automatically remain subject to the Plan as amended on that date,
            and any Monthly Benefits payable to a Participant shall be ad-
            ministered subject to the Plan as amended and all beneficiary
            designations under the Plan in effect immediately before
            January 1, 1989 shall remain in effect until changed by proper
            notice under the Plan.

      (C)   Key Employees Not Presently Party to the Plan.
            Key employees not presently party to the Plan who are designated
            by the Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and
            whose designation is approved by the Boards of Directors of
            Wisconsin Energy Corporation and the employing company or
            companies shall be eligible as Participants for payments under the
            Plan in accordance with the provisions hereof.

      (D)   Removal of a Participant.
            A Participant may be removed from the Plan at any time  upon the
            recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy

                                     - 2 -

            Corporation and with the approval of the Boards of Directors of
            Wisconsin Energy Corporation and the employing company or
            companies, provided no such removal may eliminate or reduce any
            benefits which are protected under Section 12 hereof in the event
            of termination of this Plan.

3.    Payments Upon Retirement.  Upon the retirement of a Participant as an
      employee of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and all of its subsidiaries
      either:
            (a)   at age 60 (or in Mr. R. A. Abdoo's case, age 58, and if his
                  actual retirement occurs at or after age 58 but prior to age
                  60, he shall be deemed to be age 60 for purposes of all
                  calculations respecting Monthly Benefits A and B hereof) or
                  later, or
            (b)   prior to age 60 (or in Mr. R. A. Abdoo's case, age 58)
                  subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer of
                  Wisconsin Energy Corporation with the Boards of Directors of
                  the Wisconsin Energy Corporation and employing company or
                  companies,
      such Participant shall be entitled to receive Monthly Benefit A and
      Monthly Benefit B described in paragraph 4 below.  Further, subject to
      the above conditions, Participants listed on the attached Schedule (the
      "Listed Participants") shall be entitled to receive Monthly Benefit C
      described in paragraph 4 below.

4.    Amount of Benefit.  Monthly Benefit A shall equal (a) less (b) where:
            (a)   equals the Participant's accrued benefit(s), as of the date
            of determination, calculated on a straight life annuity basis
            under the provisions of the Company's and/or all of its
            subsidiaries' applicable qualified defined benefit retirement
                                     - 3 -
<PAGE> 5
            plan(s), without regard to any limitations on benefits imposed by
            IRC Section 415 or the $200,000 limitation on annual compensation,
            as adjusted from time to time, imposed by IRC Section 401(a)(17)
            applicable to the qualified plan; and
            (b)   equals the Participant's accrued benefit(s), as of the date
            of determination, calculated on a straight life annuity basis
            under the provisions of the Company's and/or its subsidiaries'
            applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan(s).

      For all Participants whose service with the Company or any of its
      subsidiaries terminated on or before December 31, 1993, Monthly
      Benefit B and post retirement death benefits with respect to Monthly
      Benefit B shall be as defined in this plan as restated effective as of
      January 1, 1989 (including amendments made in February, 1990 which
      became effective as of January 1, 1989).  For all Participants still in
      the active service of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on and
      after January 1, 1994, Monthly Benefit B shall equal a life annuity of
      10% of the average total monthly compensation received by the
      Participant from the Company and/or all of its subsidiaries during
      whichever period of 36 consecutive months produces the highest average
      total monthly compensation.  [Solely for purposes of determining Monthly
      Benefit B, average total monthly compensation during such 36-month
      period includes the monthly average of (i) any Incentive Award
      determined under the Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan,
      calculated as of the date of determination as if then paid in full as
      base salary and disregarding the actual date of payment of any such
      Incentive Award and the amount thereof at the time of payment, (ii) the
      amount of any other annual incentive salary award paid to the
      Participant, and (iii) any amounts of base salary that would have been
      paid to the Participant during such 36-month period but are not paid
                                     - 4 -

      because of deferral elections made by the Participant under a savings or
      other deferred compensation plan.]

      Monthly Benefit C shall equal (a) less (b) where:
            (a)   equals the Listed Participant's accrued benefit(s), as of
            the date of determination, calculated on a straight life annuity
            basis under the provisions of the Wisconsin Electric Power Company
            Management Employees' Retirement Plan and/or the Wisconsin Natural
            Gas Company Management Employees' Retirement Plan, as in effect on
            December 31, 1988 (the "1988 Management Plans", whichever such
            Plan(s) applied to the Listed Participant as of December 31, 1988)
            plus any benefits under any individual supplemental benefits
            agreement(s) between the Company, and/or any of its subsidiaries
            and any Listed Participant, all calculated without regard to any
            limitations imposed by IRC Section 415 or the $200,000 limitation
            on annual compensation, as adjusted from time to time, imposed by
            IRC 401(a)(17), and all calculated under the further assumptions
            that (i) the 1988 Management Plans continued without change until
            the date of determination; (ii) any deferrals of base salary
            elected by the Listed Participant under the Wisconsin Energy
            Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan were disregarded
            and instead included in the compensation base for calculating
            retirement income under the 1988 Management Plans; and (iii) the
            amount of any Incentive Award or special award to the Listed
            Participant, calculated at the time of its determination by the
            Board, had also been included in the compensation base for
            calculating retirement income under the 1988 Management Plans; and

            (b)   equals the sum of (i) the Listed Participant's accrued bene-
            fit(s), as of the date of determination, calculated on a straight
                                     - 5 -

            life annuity basis under the provisions of the Wisconsin Electric
            Power Company Management Employees' Retirement Plan and/or the
            Wisconsin Natural Gas Company Management Employees' Retirement
            Plan, whichever such Plan(s) applies to the Listed Participant, as
            in effect on the date of determination; plus (ii) any actual
            benefits under any individual supplemental benefits agreement(s)
            between the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and any Listed
            Participant, plus (iii) any actual Monthly Benefit A, and plus
            (iv) any actual "make whole" pension supplements due under the
            provisions of Section IX(1) and (2) of the Wisconsin Energy
            Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

5.    Form of Payment.  Monthly Benefits A, B and C shall be paid in the same
      form as the benefit(s) paid from the Company's and/or its subsidiaries'
      applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan(s).  However, if
      the Participant elects the Single Sum Equivalent form under the
      qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Participant must choose
      another form of payment for Monthly Benefits A, B and C that is
      available under the qualified defined benefit retirement plan.  If a
      form other than a straight life annuity is applicable, the same option
      and actuarial equivalent factors that apply in such qualified defined
      benefit retirement plans(s) shall apply to Monthly Benefits A, B and C. 
      Monthly Benefits A, B and C shall be administered in the same manner as
      the provisions of the applicable qualified retirement plan(s) are
      administered.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a Participant
      who is entitled to begin receiving payments under any or all of Monthly
      Benefits A, B or C may make a written request to the Board of Directors
      of Wisconsin Energy Corporation for a lump sum payment of an amount
      equal to the then present value of all benefits then accrued under this
      plan, calculated using (i) an interest rate equal to the five-year
                                     - 6 -
<PAGE> 8
      United States Treasury Note yield in effect on the last business day of
      the month prior to payment as such yield is reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or comparable publication and (ii) the mortality tables then in
      use under the qualified defined benefit plan of the Company or its
      subsidiaries applicable to the Participant.  The Board of Directors, in
      its sole and absolute discretion, may grant or deny such request.

6.    Preretirement Death Benefits Respecting Monthly Benefits A and C. 
      Provided that a Participant is entitled to preretirement spouse's
      benefits under the Company's and/or its subsidiaries' applicable
      qualified defined benefit retirement plan(s), payments of Monthly
      Benefits A and C (reduced according to the same ratio as the spouse's
      benefit(s) under the qualified plan(s) bears to the Participant's
      accrued benefit(s) as of his/her date of death) shall become payable
      upon the death of the Participant before retirement to the spouse of
      such Participant for the balance of his/her lifetime.

7.    Pre- and Post-Retirement Death Benefits Respecting Monthly Benefit B. 
      If a Participant dies before payments of Monthly Benefit B commence, the
      beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant shall become
      entitled to receive a lump sum amount equal to the then present value of
      Monthly Benefit B, calculated using (i) an interest rate equal to the
      five-year United States Treasury Note yield in effect on the last
      business day of the month prior to the date of death as such yield is
      reported in the Wall Street Journal or comparable publication, and
      (ii) the mortality tables then in use under the qualified defined
      benefit plan of the Company or its subsidiaries applicable to the
      Participant.  If a retired Participant receiving Monthly Benefit B dies,
                                     - 7 -
<PAGE> 9
      whether any payments continue thereafter will depend upon the form of
      payment such Participant had elected.

8.    Payments Upon Change in Control.  For purposes of this paragraph 8, a
      "Change in Control" with respect to the Company shall mean the
      occurrence of any of the following events, as a result of one
      transaction or a series of transactions:

            (a)   any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
                  and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but
                  excluding the Company, its affiliates and any qualified or
                  non-qualified plan maintained by the Company or its
                  affiliates) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
                  Rule 13d-3 promulgated under such Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more
                  than 20% of the combined voting power of the Company's then
                  outstanding securities;

            (b)   individuals who constitute a majority of the Board
                  immediately prior to a contested election for positions on
                  the Board cease to constitute a majority as a result of such
                  contested election;

            (c)   the Company is combined (by merger, share exchange,
                  consolidation, or otherwise) with another corporation and as
                  a result of such combination, less than 60% of the
                  outstanding securities of the surviving or resulting
                  corporation are owned in the aggregate by the former
                  shareholders of the Company;




                                     - 8 -
<PAGE> 10

            (d)   the Company sells, leases, or otherwise transfers all or
                  substantially all of its properties or assets not in the
                  ordinary course of business to another person or entity; or

            (e)   the Board determines in its sole and absolute discretion
                  that there has been a Change in Control of the Company.

      These Change in Control provisions shall apply to successive Changes in
      Control on an individual transaction basis.

      Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, then notwithstanding
      any other provision of this plan, the Company shall promptly cause
      to be paid to each active and retired Participant or beneficiary
      receiving benefits under this plan a lump sum amount equal to the
      then present value of all benefits then accrued under this plan,
      calculated using (i) an interest rate equal to the five-year
      United States Treasury Note yield in effect on the last business
      day of the month prior to the date when a Change in Control event
      described in subparagraphs (a) through (e) above has occurred as
      such yield is reported in the Wall Street Journal or comparable
      publication, and (ii) the mortality tables then in use under the
      qualified defined benefit plan of the Company or its subsidiaries
      applicable to the Participant.  Such payments shall be made
      without regard to whether the Participant's employment with the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries is continuing.  However, if the
      Participant in fact so continues and this plan continues,
      appropriate provisions shall be made so that any subsequent
      payments made from this plan are reduced to reflect the value of
      such lump sum payments.


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE> 11
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph 8, none of the
      transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and
      among Northern States Power Company, Wisconsin Energy Corporation,
      Northern Power Wisconsin Corp., and WEC Sub Corp., dated as of April 28,
      1995, shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of this Plan.

9.    Government Regulations.  It is intended that the Plan will comply with
      all applicable laws and governmental regulations, and the Company and/or
      its subsidiaries shall not be obligated to perform an obligation
      hereunder in any case where, in the opinion of the Company's Counsel,
      such performance would result in violation of any law or regulation. 
      All amounts payable under this plan shall be subject to all applicable
      withholding taxes.

10.   Nonassignment.  No benefit(s) under the Plan, nor any other interest
      hereunder of any Participant or beneficiary shall be assignable,
      transferable, or subject to sale, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation,
      anticipation, garnishment, attachment, execution, or levy of any kind.

11.   Provision of Benefits.  The Company may establish a grantor trust (a
      "rabbi trust") to serve as a vehicle to hold such contributions as the
      Company may choose to make to pre-fund its obligation for benefits
      hereunder, but the trust shall be designed so that all assets therein
      are subject to the claims of the creditors of the Company or any of its
      subsidiaries which have used such rabbi trust in the event of
      insolvency, consistent with the provisions of Revenue Procedure 92-64. 
      Notwithstanding the existence of such a rabbi trust, the plan shall
      remain an unfunded plan.  A Participant's rights to benefits under the
      plan shall be those of an unsecured creditor of the Company and/or its
      subsidiaries.



                                    - 10 -

12.   Termination or Modification of Plan.  The Board of Directors of
      Wisconsin Energy Corporation shall have the right to terminate or modify
      the Plan at any time and from time to time, provided that no such action
      may eliminate or reduce or change the time or manner of payment of any
      benefits which:  (i) have already become payable hereunder to any
      Participant or beneficiary; or (ii) would have become payable to any
      Participant without the need for any approval under the terms of
      Section 3 hereof if he or she had retired immediately before such action
      is taken.

13.   Claim Procedures.  A Participant or beneficiary (a 'Claimant') may file
      a written request for benefits or claim with the Company under the Plan. 
      In the event of any dispute with respect to such a claim, the following
      claim procedures shall apply:
            (a)   The Company, acting as the administrator for this Plan,
                  shall notify the Claimant within 90 days of receipt by the
                  Company of a written claim of its allowance or denial,
                  unless the Claimant receives written notice from the Company
                  prior to the end of the initial 90-day period indicating
                  that special circumstances require an extension of time for
                  decision.  A written notice of decision shall be provided to
                  the Claimant and if the claim is denied in whole or in part,
                  the notice shall contain the following information:  the
                  specific reasons for the denial; specific reference to
                  pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is
                  based; if applicable, a description of any additional
                  material information necessary to perfect the claim and an
                  explanation of why such information is necessary; and an ex-
                  planation of the claim review procedure.
                                    - 11 -
<PAGE> 13
            (b)   A Claimant is entitled to request a review of any denial of
                  his/her claim by the Board of Directors of the Company or
                  Committee thereof.  The request for review must be submitted
                  in writing within 60 days of mailing of notice of the
                  denial.  Absent a request for review within the 60-day pe-
                  riod, the claim will be deemed to be conclusively denied. 
                  The Claimant or his/her representative shall be entitled to
                  review all pertinent documents, and to submit issues and
                  comments orally and in writing.  The Board of Directors of
                  the Company or Committee thereof shall render a review
                  decision in writing, within 60 days after receipt of a
                  request for a review, provided that, in special
                  circumstances (such as the necessity of holding a hearing)
                  the Board of Directors of the Company or Committee thereof
                  may extend the time for decision by not more than 60 days
                  upon written notice to the Claimant.  The Claimant shall
                  receive notice of the separate review decision of the Board
                  of Directors or Committee, together with specific reasons
                  for the decision and reference to the pertinent provisions
                  of this plan.

            (c)   The Company as the administrator of this Plan shall have
                  full and complete discretionary authority to determine
                  eligibility for benefits, to construe the terms of the Plan
                  and to decide any matter presented through the claims review
                  procedure.  Any final determination by the Company shall be
                  binding on all parties.  If challenged in court, such
                  determination shall not be subject to de novo review and
                                    - 12 -
<PAGE> 14
                  shall not be overturned unless proven to be arbitrary and
                  capricious upon the evidence considered by the Company at
                  the time of such determination.

                         WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION
                          AMENDED NON-QUALIFIED TRUST


      THIS AMENDED AGREEMENT made this 26th day of January 1996, by and
between WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION ("Company") and FIRSTAR TRUST COMPANY
("Trustee");

      WHEREAS, Company has adopted the nonqualified deferred compensation
Plan(s) as listed in Appendix A;

      WHEREAS, Company and certain of its subsidiaries have incurred or expect
to incur liability under the terms of such Plan(s) with respect to the
individuals participating in such Plan(s);

      WHEREAS, Company has previously established a trust (hereinafter called
"Trust") and contributed to the Trust assets to be held therein, subject to
the claims of the creditors of the Company and all contributing subsidiaries,
in the event of Insolvency of the Company or any contributing subsidiary, as
herein defined, until paid to Plan participants and their beneficiaries in
such manner and at such times as specified in the Plan(s);

      WHEREAS, Company wishes to amend the Trust to permit Trust assets to be
invested in Company stock and to make certain other Trust changes;

      WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall
constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the
Plan(s) as an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974;

      WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company and certain of its subsidiaries
to make contributions to the Trust to provide a source of funds to assist in
the meeting of the liabilities under the Plan(s);

      NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do hereby amend the Trust and agree that the
Trust shall be comprised, held and disposed of as follows:


Section 1.  ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST

      (a)   Company has previously contributed amounts to the Trust to be
held, administered and disposed of by Trustee as provided in this Trust
Agreement.

      (b)   The Trust hereby established shall be irrevocable.

      (c)   The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust, of which Company is
the grantor, within the meaning of subpart E, part 1, subchapter J, chapter 1,
subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be
construed accordingly.

      (d)   The principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon shall be held
separate and apart from other funds of Company or any of its subsidiaries and
shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of Plan participants and
general creditors as herein set forth.  Plan participants and their
beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership 

<PAGE> 2

interest in, any assets of the Trust.  Any rights created under the Plan(s)
and this Trust Agreement shall be mere unsecured contractual rights of Plan
participants and their beneficiaries against Company.  Any assets held by the
Trust will be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company and
any contributing subsidiary under federal and state law in the event of
Insolvency, as defined in Section 3(a) herein.

      (e)   Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time, or from time to
time, make additional deposits of cash or other property in Trust with Trustee
to augment the principal to be held, administered and disposed of by Trustee
as provided in this Trust Agreement.  Neither Trustee nor any plan participant
or beneficiary shall have any right to compel such additional deposits.

      (f)   Upon a Change of Control Company shall, as soon as possible, but
in no event longer than 60 days following the Change of Control, as defined
herein, make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount that is
sufficient to pay each plan participant or beneficiary the benefits to which
plan participants or their beneficiaries would be entitled pursuant to the
terms of the plan(s) as of the date on which the Change of Control occurred.


Section 2.  PAYMENTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES.

      (a)   Company shall deliver to Trustee a schedule (the "Payment
Schedule") that indicates the amounts payable in respect of each Plan
participant (and his or her beneficiaries), that provides a formula or other
instructions acceptable to Trustee for determining the amounts so payable, the
form in which such amount is to be paid (as provided for or available under
the Plan(s)), and the time of commencement for payment of such amounts. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, Trustee shall make payments to the Plan
participants and their beneficiaries in accordance with such Payment Schedule. 
Trustee shall make provision for the reporting and withholding of any federal,
state or local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect to the
payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan(s) and shall pay amounts
withheld to the appropriate taxing authorities or determine that such amounts
have been reported, withheld and paid by Company.

      (b)   The entitlement of a Plan participant or his or her beneficiaries
to benefits under the Plan(s) shall be determined by Company or such party as
it shall designate under the Plan(s), and any claim for such benefits shall be
considered and reviewed under the procedures set out in the Plan(s).

      (c)   Company may make payment of benefits directly to Plan participants
or their beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the Plan(s). 
Company shall notify Trustee of its decision to make payment of benefits
directly prior to the time amounts are payable to participants or their
beneficiaries.  In addition, if the principal of the Trust, and any earnings
thereon, are not sufficient to make payments of benefits in accordance with
the terms of the Plan, Company shall make the balance of each such payment as
it falls due.  Trustee shall notify Company where principal and earnings are
not sufficient.


Section 3.  TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PAYMENTS TO TRUST BENEFICIARY
            WHEN COMPANY IS INSOLVENT.

      (a)   Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to Plan participants and
their beneficiaries if Company or any contributing subsidiary is Insolvent. 
Whenever the term "Company" is used in this Section 3, it shall also be deemed

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE> 3

to mean any contributing subsidiary of the Company.  Company shall be
considered "Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) Company is
unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) Company is subject to a
pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

      (b)   At all times during the continuance of this Trust, as provided in
Section 1(d) hereof, the principal and income of the Trust shall be subject to
claims of general creditors of Company under federal and state law as set
forth below.

            (1)   The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of
      Company shall have the duty to inform Trustee in writing of Company's
      Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a creditor of Company alleges in
      writing to Trustee that Company has become Insolvent, Trustee shall
      determine whether Company is Insolvent and, pending such determination,
      Trustee shall discontinue payment of benefits to Plan participants or
      their beneficiaries.

            (2)   Unless Trustee has actual knowledge of Company's Insolvency,
      or has received notice from Company or a person claiming to be a
      creditor alleging that Company is Insolvent, Trustee shall have no duty
      to inquire whether Company is Insolvent.  Trustee may in all events rely
      on such evidence concerning Company's solvency as may be furnished to
      Trustee and that provides Trustee with a reasonable basis for making a
      determination concerning Company's solvency.

            (3)   If at any time Trustee has determined that Company is
      Insolvent, Trustee shall discontinue payments to Plan participants or
      their beneficiaries and shall hold the assets of the Trust for the
      benefit of Company's general creditors.  Nothing in this Trust Agreement
      shall in any way diminish any rights of Plan participants or their bene-
      ficiaries to pursue their rights as general creditors of Company with
      respect to benefits due under the Plan(s) or otherwise.

            (4)   Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Plan
      participants or their beneficiaries in accordance with Section 2 of this
      Trust Agreement only after Trustee has determined that Company is not
      Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).

      (c)   Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee discontinues
the payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof and
subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such
discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due to Plan
participants or their beneficiaries under the terms of the Plan(s) for the
period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any payments made
to Plan participants or their beneficiaries by Company in lieu of the payments
provided for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.


Section 4.  PAYMENTS TO COMPANY.

      Except as provided in Section 3 hereof, after the Trust has become
irrevocable, Company shall have no right or power to direct Trustee to return
to Company or to divert to others any of the Trust assets before all payment
of benefits have been made to Plan participants and their beneficiaries
pursuant to the terms of the Plan(s).

Section 5.  INVESTMENT AUTHORITY.

      (a)   Trustee may invest in securities (including stock or rights to
acquire stock) or obligations issued by Company.  All rights associated with
assets of the Trust shall be exercised by Trustee or the person designated by
Trustee, and shall in no event be exercisable by or rest with plan
participants.  

Company shall have the right at anytime, and from time to time in its sole
discretion, to substitute assets of equal fair market value for any asset held
by the Trust.  This right is exercisable by Company in a nonfiduciary capacity
without the approval or consent of any person in a fiduciary capacity.

      (b)   Subject to (a) above, Trustee shall invest and reinvest the
principal and income of the Trust fund in any and all common stocks, preferred
stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, mortgages, equipment trust certificates,
investment trust certificates, common, collective or group trust investments
or mutual fund investments (including any such trusts or funds as may be
established by Trustee or any of its affiliates), real and personal property
wherever situated, and in such other property, investments and securities of
any kind, class or character as Trustee may deem suitable for the Trust. 
Trustee shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to do all such acts,
execute all such instruments, take all such proceedings and exercise all
rights and privileges with respect to any property or asset constituting a
part of the Trust fund as if Trustee were the absolute owner thereof.

      (c)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust, Company, by
action of its Board or Executive Committee, may from time to time appoint one
or more independent professional investment advisors (each of which is
hereinafter called an "Investment Advisor") with respect to the total or any
portion of the Trust fund.  Trustee shall not be required to be a party to any
agreement appointing an Investment Advisor except in the case where Company
requests Trustee to enter into an agency and custody agreement with an
Investment Advisor which will also be the depository and custodian of the
Trust fund assets allocated to its management; provided further that the terms
and conditions of appointment, authority, retention and removal of Investment
Advisor shall be the sole responsibility of Company.  Investment Advisor shall
have and exercise all of the investment powers reserved to Trustee under this
Trust Agreement during the period of such appointment.  Upon receipt of
written notice from Company of the appointment of such Investment Advisor,
Trustee shall perform such custodial and ministerial acts relating to
investments as may be required to carry out the directions of Investment
Advisor and the administration of such portion of the Trust fund for which an
advisor is appointed, but shall be relieved of all responsibility for
investment or failure to invest in accordance with this Trust Agreement for
such portion of the Trust fund during the period of such appointment, except
that Trustee may invest and reinvest income and principal cash in
U.S. treasury bills, commercial paper, or other short-term investments,
including in interests in any common, collective or group trust fund or mutual
fund that is created and maintained by Trustee or any of its affiliates from
time to time for the collective short-term investment of Trust cash reserves,
pending receipt of directions as to the investment or disposition of such
cash.


Section 6.  DISPOSITION OF INCOME.

      During the term of this Trust, all income received by the Trust, net of
expenses and taxes, shall be accumulated and reinvested.

Section 7.  ACCOUNTING BY TRUSTEE.

      With respect to the Trust fund and each Plan, Trustee shall keep or
cause to be maintained accurate and detailed accounts of all investments,
receipts and disbursements and other transactions hereunder, and all accounts,
books and records relating thereto shall be open to inspection and audit at
all reasonable times by any person or persons designated by Company.  Trustee
shall file with Company annually or more frequently if requested a written
report setting forth all investments, receipts and disbursements, and other
transactions effected by them to the date covered by the report, and showing
all cash and other property held at the end of such period.  At the request of
Company, Trustee shall establish and maintain separate records on
contributions made hereunder by Company and any contributing subsidiary.  Such
funds may be commingled, invested and reinvested hereunder in all respects as
a commingled single fund, but Trustee, to the extent it is maintaining
separate records hereunder as to the contributing entity, shall always
maintain separate accounts within the Trust showing the value of the separate
interests of each contributing entity, on a pro rata basis.


Section 8.  RESPONSIBILITY OF TRUSTEE.

      (a)   Trustee shall have no duty to review or recommend the sale,
retention or other disposition of any asset purchased or retained at the
direction of Investment Advisor, nor shall Trustee have any personal liability
or responsibility for any loss to or depreciation of such portion of the Trust
fund for which an advisor is appointed occasioned by reason of the purchase,
sale or retention of any asset in accordance with the direction of Investment
Advisor, or by reason of not having sold such asset so purchased or retained
in the absence of any direction from Investment Advisor to make such sale. 
All directions given to Trustee by Investment Advisor, including broker's con-
firmations, shall be given in writing or given orally and immediately
confirmed in writing.  Company shall indemnify and hold Trustee harmless from
and against any claim, loss or expense (including reasonable counsel fees)
arising out of anything done or omitted by Trustee in reliance on the
directions (or the absence of any directions) of Company or any Investment
Advisor appointed under Section 5(c) above.

      (b)   Trustee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel for
Company or in the employ of Company, in respect to any of its rights, duties
and obligations hereunder and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining
from acting in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

      (c)   Trustee may hire agents, accountants, actuaries, investment
advisors, financial consultants or other professionals to assist it in
performing any of its duties or obligations hereunder.

      (d)   Trustee shall have, without exclusion, all powers conferred on
Trustees by applicable law, unless expressly provided otherwise herein,
provided, however, that if an insurance policy is held as a asset of the
Trust, Trustee shall have no power to name a beneficiary of the policy other
than the Trust, to assign the policy (as distinct from conversion of the
policy to a different form) other than to a successor Trustee, or to loan to
any person the proceeds of any borrowing against such policy.

      (e)   Notwithstanding any powers granted to Trustee pursuant to this
Trust Agreement or to applicable law, Trustee shall not have any power that
could give this Trust the objective of carrying on a business and dividing the
gains therefrom, within the meaning of section 301.7701-2 of the Procedure and
Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.

expenses shall be paid from the Trust.

Section 10. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE.

      (a)   Trustee may resign at any time by written notice to Company, which
shall be effective 60 days after receipt of such notice unless Company and
Trustee agree otherwise.

shorter notice accepted by Trustee.

      (c)   Upon resignation or removal of Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee, all assets shall subsequently be transferred to the
successor Trustee.  The transfer shall be completed within 120 days after
receipt of notice of resignation removal or transfer, unless Company extends
the time limit.

      (d)   If Trustee resigns or is removed, a successor shall be appointed,
in accordance with Section 11 hereof, by the effective date of resignation or
removal under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.  If no such appointment
has been made, Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a successor or for instructions.  All expenses of Trustee in
connection with the proceeding shall be allowed as administrative expenses of
the Trust.


Section 11. APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.

      If Trustee resigns or is removed in accordance with Section 10(a) or (b)
hereof, Company may appoint any third party, such as a bank trust department
or other party that may be granted corporate trustee powers under state law,
as a successor to replace Trustee upon resignation or removal.  The
appointment shall be effective when accepted in writing by the new Trustee,
who shall have all of the rights and powers of the former Trustee, including
ownership rights in the Trust assets.  The former Trustee shall execute any
instrument necessary or reasonably requested by Company or the successor
Trustee to evidence the transfer.


Section 12. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.

      (a)   This Trust Agreement may be amended by a written instrument
executed by Trustee and Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
amendment shall conflict with the terms of the Plan(s) or shall make the Trust
revocable after it has become irrevocable in accordance with Section 1(b)
hereof.

      (b)   The Trust shall not terminate until the date on which Plan
participants and their beneficiaries are no longer entitled to benefits

assets remaining in the Trust shall be returned to Company.

      (c)   Upon written approval of participants or beneficiaries entitled to
payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan(s), Company may
terminate this Trust prior to the time all benefit payments under the Plan(s) 
                                     - 6 -
<PAGE> 7

have been made.  All assets in the Trust at termination shall be returned to
Company.


Section 13. MISCELLANEOUS.

      (a)   Any provision of this Trust Agreement prohibited by law shall be
ineffective to the extent of any such prohibition, without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof.

      (b)   Benefits payable to Plan participants and their beneficiaries
under this Trust Agreement may not be anticipated, assigned (either at law or

      and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but excluding Company,
      its affiliates and any qualified or non-qualified plan maintained by
      Company or its affiliates), becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined

      securities of Company representing more than 20% of the combined voting
      power of Company's then outstanding securities;

            (2)   individuals who constitute a majority of the Board
      immediately prior to a contested election for positions on the Board
      cease to constitute a majority as a result of such contested election;

            (3)   Company is combined (by merger, share exchange,
      consolidation, or otherwise) with another corporation and as a result of
      such combination, less than 60% of the outstanding securities of the
      surviving or resulting corporation are owned in the aggregate by the
      former shareholders of Company;

            (4)   Company sells, leases, or otherwise transfers all or
      substantially all of its properties or assets not in the ordinary course
      of business to another person or entity; or

            (5)   the Board determines in its sole and absolute discretion

                         ----------------------------

                     EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                     ------------------------------------

I.     OBJECTIVES
       This Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is maintained
       by Wisconsin Energy Corporation (the "Company"), effective January 1,
       1989, to enable eligible participants, on a calendar year basis, an
       opportunity to defer income until retirement or other termination of
       employment.

II.    ELIGIBILITY

       Elected officers and other management or highly compensated employees
       of the Company and its utility subsidiaries as may be designated by
       the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and approved by the
       Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and by the Board(s) of
       Directors of the employing company or companies are eligible to
       participate in the Plan.  It is intended that participation in the
       Plan be limited to a select group of management or highly compensated
       employees within the meaning of Title 1 of the Employee Retirement
       Income Security Act and that the designation of eligible participants
       will generally occur near the end of a calendar year, to become
       effective as of the start of the immediately following calendar year.

III.   DEFINITION OF COVERED COMPENSATION

       Compensation that may be deferred into the Plan includes:

       (1)  Annual base salary,

       (2)  Individual Incentive Awards under the Company's Executive
            Incentive Compensation Plan, and

       (3)  Performance awards under the Company's Short-Term Performance Plan
            or other such short-term performance plan(s) as approved by the
            Board.

IV.    AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION WHICH MAY BE DEFERRED

       Participants in the Plan may elect to defer up to 30% of base salary
       compensation, and 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of their Performance Awards as
       described hereinafter.  Regarding such other Board approved short-term
       performance plan(s), the amount of compensation which may be deferred
       will be specified in the respective plan(s).

V.     DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

       (1)  Base Salary

            A participant may elect to defer from 1% to 30% of monthly base
            salary (defined as the aggregate monthly base salary from the
            Company and its utility subsidiaries).  A written deferral
            election form regarding base salary must be filed with the Company
            in accordance with rules established by the Company.  The deferral
            election shall only be effective as to compensation earned from


<PAGE> 3

            and after the first day of the month immediately following the
            date the form is received by the Company.  

       (2)  Performance Awards and such other awards as approved by the Board

            A participant may elect to defer from 25% to 100% (increments of
            25%) of any Performance Award under the Company's Short-Term
            Performance Plan.  A written deferral election form regarding a
            Performance Award which may ultimately become payable on account
            of a participant's services during the calendar year under the
            Company's Short-Term Performance Plan (or any other Board approved
            short-term performance plan) must be filed with the Company no
            later than December 31st of such calendar year and in any event,
            prior to the time that the participant has earned an absolute and
            unconditional right to payment.

       (3)  Deferral Election Rules

            A participant may amend or revoke any deferral election regarding
            base salary under (1) above at any time by giving written notice
            to the Company; such notice shall become effective the first day
            of the month immediately following receipt of such notice by the
            Company.  A participant may not revoke a deferral election
            regarding either portion of an Incentive Award, a Performance
            Award or any such like award once such election has been made. 
            Any election or revocation will be given prospective effect only
            and will not affect prior deferrals.

VI.    EARNINGS CREDITED
       (1)  An amount equivalent to the deferrals elected regarding base
            salary, Incentive Awards, Performance Awards, or such other Board
            approved short-term performance plan awards shall be credited to a
            bookkeeping account on the records of the Company in the name of
            the participant, at the time when such base salary, Incentive
            Awards, Performance Awards or other awards would otherwise have
            been payable in cash had the participant not made such deferral
            elections.  Such account shall be simply an unsecured claim
            against the general assets of the Company.  A participant shall
            have no interest in such account, which is established merely as
            an accounting convenience.

       (2)  Each participant may elect to have the participant's account
            invested in the Interest Rate Fund or WEC Stock Fund as described
            below:

            (i)   Interest Rate Fund.  Under this method, earnings shall be
                  credited on the average balance in each account determined
                  by averaging the beginning and ending balance of such
                  account within the period intervening since interest was
                  last credited to the account (except, in the case of a new
                  participant, within the period from the effective date of
                  such participant's participation in the Plan to the end of
                  the next June 30 or December 31 or the date such participant
                  terminates participation, whichever is earlier) and shall be
                  credited to the account semiannually, each year, until all
                  distributions to which participant, participant's estate or
                  beneficiary is entitled shall have been made.  Whenever a
                  lump sum amount or final distribution is made as of a date

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE> 4

                  other than June 30 or December 31, interest shall be
                  credited to the account as of such payment date.  The rate
                  of interest shall be the prime commercial rate as published
                  by Firstar Bank, Milwaukee, N.A. in effect on the last day
                  of the period, except for any period in which any lump sum
                  amount or final distribution from an account is made as of a
                  date other than the end of the period, in which case the
                  rate of interest shall be the prime commercial rate as
                  published by Firstar Bank, Milwaukee, N.A. in effect on the
                  date interest was last credited as determined above.

            (ii)  WEC Stock Fund.  Under this method, earnings shall be
                  credited at a rate which reflects the performance of
                  Wisconsin Energy Corporation common stock ("WEC stock"). 
                  The value of the participant's account in the WEC Stock Fund
                  shall be determined by taking into account changes in the
                  value of WEC stock, dividends paid on WEC stock and any
                  changes in the capital structure of the Company affecting
                  the value of WEC stock.

       (3)  Investment of Deferrals

       The participant's deferral election shall identify the Fund or Funds
       in which the deferrals shall be invested and may be in 10% increments.

       (4)  Investment Transfer

       In accordance with rules established by the Company, a Participant may
       make a one-time election to transfer all or part of the Participant's
       Account in the Interest Rate Fund to the WEC Stock Fund.

VII.   VESTING

       Participants are always 100% vested in amounts deferred to the Plan
       plus earnings credited to their account.

VIII.  BENEFIT PAYMENT

       (1)  In the Event of Retirement

            At the time when a participant completes any deferral election
            form under this Plan, the participant shall also irrevocably
            specify the method of payment in which all deferred compensation
            covered by such election form shall be made if the participant
            terminates service with the Company or its utility subsidiaries
            because of "retirement".  For purposes of the Plan, "retirement"
            shall have occurred if the participant terminates service and
            thereupon begins to receive an immediate retirement income benefit
            under the Company's or a utility subsidiary's tax-qualified
            defined benefit retirement plan or would have been able to receive
            such an income had he been covered under such plan.  The available
            methods under such circumstances are:

            (i)   a single lump sum payment as soon as practical after the
                  participant's retirement,

          (ii)    a single lump sum payment to be made as of the first
                  business day of the year immediately following the
                  participant's retirement,

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE> 5

         (iii)    payment over a ten-year period [as of the first business day
                  of the January immediately following the participant's
                  retirement, 1/10th of the amount credited to the
                  participant's account (the "principal amount") shall be paid
                  to the participant and as of the first business day of each
                  January thereafter, 1/10th of the principal amount and in
                  addition thereto any interest credited to the account in the
                  period intervening since the last payment shall be paid
                  until a total of ten payments have been made.  If any share
                  equivalents portion of an Incentive award shall be first
                  credited to the participant's account during the ten-year
                  period, it shall be treated for payout purposes solely as an
                  additional interest credit.  Such ten payments, regardless
                  of the total amount thereof, shall constitute full payment
                  of all amounts due the Participant under this Plan],

          (iv)    payment over a five year period [calculated in the same
                  fashion as provided in subparagraph (iii) above, but
                  substituting "1/5th" for "1/1Oth" and "five" for "ten"
                  wherever the same appear].

            A participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary or
            beneficiaries to receive a distribution with respect to any
            portion of such participant's account remaining unpaid at the
            participant's death.  Such designation shall be effected by filing
            written notification with the Company in the form prescribed by it
            and may be changed from time to time by similar action.  If the
            participant fails to make such designation, or if the beneficiary
            predeceases the participant, any such distribution shall be paid
            to the participant's estate within six months after the Company
            has been notified of such death.

            If a retired participant dies before all payments have been made
            under the selected method, the remaining payments shall be paid to
            the beneficiary for the balance of the applicable ten- or five-
            year period (or under the lump sum method, if that was in effect). 
            If the last beneficiary shall die before receiving the full amount
            payable under this Plan, then the balance of the account not paid
            shall be paid in a single lump sum to the estate of such
            beneficiary within six months after the Company has been notified
            of such death.

       (2)  In the Event of Death Prior to Termination of Employment

            If a participant dies prior to termination of employment with the
            Company or its utility subsidiaries, the designated beneficiary
            shall be paid the entire balance of the account in a single lump
            sum, with such distribution to be made within six months after the
            Company has been notified of such death.  If the participant has
            failed to designate a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary
            predeceases the participant, the entire balance of the account
            shall be paid to the participant's estate within six months after
            the Company has been notified of such death.

       (3)  In the Event of Termination for Reason Other Than Retirement or
            Death

            If a participant terminates employment with the Company or its
            utility subsidiaries for a reason other than retirement or death,

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE> 6

            the participant's account shall be paid to the participant in a
            single lump sum.  Such distribution will be made within 90 days of
            termination of employment.

       (4)  No Acceleration of Incentive Award Payment

            It is recognized that the Company's Executive Incentive
            Compensation Plan (under which the last Incentive Award was made
            in January of 1992 and which Plan has been currently replaced by
            the Short-Term Performance Plan) provided for a three-year
            deferred payout of the share equivalents portion of any Incentive
            Award.  Thus, a participant who filed a deferral election form as
            to any part of the share equivalents portion of an Incentive Award
            for a particular year will not have any amount with respect
            thereto credited to his account until the end of such three-year
            period.  Further, nothing in this Article VIII shall accelerate
            the time when the aforesaid three-year period expires, so that
            whenever reference is made in this Plan to a single lump sum
            payment, this Plan refers only to amounts already credited to the
            participant's account at the time, not to future credits to the
            account that would have accrued had the participant continued in
            service.

       (5)  Optional Lump Sum Payments Upon Approval by Board

            Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a participant at the
            time of retirement may make a written request to the Board for a
            single lump sum payment of all amounts covered by this
            Article VIII and Article IX as soon as practical after the
            participant's retirement.  As to any "make whole" retirement
            income or long-term disability benefit covered by Article IX, the
            same shall be converted into a single lump sum payment equal to
            the then present value of such benefit, calculated using (i) an
            interest rate equal to the five-year United States Treasury Note
            yield in effect on the last business day of the month prior to the
            payment as such yield is reported in the Wall Street Journal or
            comparable publication, (ii) the mortality tables then in use
            under the qualified defined benefit plan of the Company or its
            subsidiaries applicable to the participant, and (iii) any other
            factors needed in order to determine the present value of the
            "make whole" long-term disability benefit covered by Article IX as
            determined in good faith by the Company.  The Board, in its sole
            and absolute discretion, may grant or deny such request.

       (6)  Mandatory Lump Sum Payments Upon Change in Control

            For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" with
            respect to the Company shall mean the occurrence of any of the
            following events, as a result of one transaction or a series of
            transactions:

            (a)   any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
                  and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but
                  excluding the Company, its affiliates and any qualified or
                  non-qualified plan maintained by the Company or its
                  affiliates) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
                  Rule 13d-3 promulgated under such Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more
                  than 20% of the combined voting power of the Company's then
                  outstanding securities;
                                     - 5 -
<PAGE> 7

            (b)   individuals who constitute a majority of the Board
                  immediately prior to a contested election for positions on
                  the Board cease to constitute a majority as a result of such
                  contested election;

            (c)   the Company is combined (by merger, share exchange,
                  consolidation, or otherwise) with another corporation and as
                  a result of such combination, less than 60% of the
                  outstanding securities of the surviving or resulting
                  corporation are owned in the aggregate by the former
                  shareholders of the Company;

            (d)   the Company sells, leases, or otherwise transfers all or
                  substantially all of its properties or assets not in the
                  ordinary course of business to another person or entity; or

            (e)   the Board determines in its sole and absolute discretion
                  that there has been a Change in Control of the Company.

            These Change in Control provisions shall apply to successive
            Changes in Control on an individual transaction basis.

            Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, then notwithstanding
            any other provision of this Plan, the Company shall promptly cause
            to be paid to each active and retired participant or beneficiary
            receiving benefits under this Plan a single lump sum payment for
            all amounts covered by this Article VIII and Article IX
            (calculated as set forth in paragraph (5) above), without regard
            to whether any participant's employment with the Company or any of
            its subsidiaries is continuing.  However, if the participant in
            fact so continues and this Plan continues, appropriate provisions
            shall be made so that any subsequent payments made from this Plan
            are reduced to reflect the value of such lump sum payment. 
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount credited to the WEC
            Stock Fund for an "insider" subject to Section 16 of the
            Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may not be distributed prior to
            the Participant's death, retirement, disability or termination of
            employment.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, none of the
            transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger by
            and among Northern States Power Company, Wisconsin Energy
            Corporation, Northern Power Wisconsin Corp., and WEC Subcorp.,
            dated as of April 28, 1995 shall constitute a Change in Control
            for purposes of the Plan.

       (7)  Cash Distributions
            
            All distributions under the Plan shall be in cash.

IX.    "MAKE WHOLE" RETIREMENT INCOME BENEFIT, COMPANY SAVINGS PLAN MATCH AND
       LONG-TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT

       (1)  "Make Whole" Retirement Income Benefit with Respect to Base Salary
            Deferrals

            Base salary which is deferred pursuant to this Plan cannot be
            included in the compensation base for calculating retirement
            income under qualified defined benefit retirement plans of the

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE> 8

            Company and its utility subsidiaries (the "Pension Plans"). 
            Therefore, a "make whole" benefit will be paid from this Plan as a
            pension supplement to a participant whose deferrals of base salary
            hereunder result in a lesser pension payment under the Pension
            Plans.  Such pension supplement shall equal the monthly amount by
            which the participant's pension under the Pension Plans
            (calculated for this purpose without regard to any limitation on
            benefits imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code or
            the $200,000  limitation on annual compensation, as adjusted from
            time to time, imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of such Code;
            hereinafter, the "IRS Limitations") was less because deferrals of
            base salary under this Plan were not taken into account in the
            calculation of such participant's pension (but the amount of any
            Monthly Benefit A applicable to the participant under the
            Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan shall be taken
            into account to avoid any duplication of the pension supplement
            provided hereunder).  Payment of such pension supplement shall
            commence at the same time and be paid in the same form as the
            benefit paid under the Pension Plans.  This section applies to all
            forms of pensions payable under the Pension Plans, including
            spousal pensions.  All pension supplements paid hereunder shall be
            paid out of general corporate assets or out of a grantor trust as
            provided in Article XII hereof.

       (2)  "Make Whole" Retirement Income Benefit with Respect to Performance
            and Incentive Awards and such other awards as approved by the
            Board

            Performance and Incentive Awards are excluded from the
            compensation base used for calculating retirement income under the
            Pension Plans.  Further, in certain circumstances, a participant
            may have been granted a special award and such special awards are
            likewise excluded.  Therefore, a "make whole" benefit will be paid
            from this Plan as a pension supplement to a participant whose
            pension paid under the Pension Plans would have been greater had a
            Performance Award, Incentive Award or special awards been included
            in the compensation base of the Pension Plans.  Such pension
            supplement shall equal the monthly amount of increase in the
            participant's pension benefit under the Pension Plans (calculated
            for this purpose without regard to the IRS Limitations) that would
            have resulted if the amount of any Performance Award, Incentive
            Award or special award, calculated as to an Incentive Award or
            Performance Award at the time of its determination by the Board
            under Article VI(1) of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Executive
            Incentive Compensation Plan or under Article 5 of the Short Term
            Performance Plan and as to such special award at the time of its
            determination by the Board, had then been paid in full as base
            salary (but the amount of any Monthly Benefit A applicable to the
            participant under the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement
            Plan shall be taken into account to avoid any duplication of the
            pension supplement provided hereunder).  Since the date of
            determination rather than the date of payment is controlling for
            purposes of the calculation of such pension supplement, the actual
            date of payment of any Performance, Incentive or special award and
            the amount of any Performance, Incentive or special award at the
            time of payment shall be disregarded.  Payment of such pension
            supplement shall commence at the same time and be paid in the same
            form as the benefit paid under the Pension Plans.  This section
            applies to all forms of pensions payable under the Pension Plans,

                                     - 7 -
<PAGE> 9

            including spousal pensions.  All pension supplements paid
            hereunder shall be paid out of general corporate assets or out of
            a grantor trust as provided in Article XII hereof.  Any other
            Board approved short-term performance plan must also have Board
            approval for specific inclusion in this "make whole" retirement
            income benefit or such inclusion must be specified in such other
            Board approved short-term performance plan prior to the payment of
            any "make whole" retirement income benefit hereunder.

       (3)  Management Employee Savings Plan Match

            It is the intent of this Plan that a participant not suffer any
            loss with respect to an employer savings plan match under the
            Management Employee Savings Plan of the Company and its utility
            subsidiaries (the "Savings Plan") because of (a) having elected
            deferrals of base salary under this Plan, (b) the limitation
            imposed by Section 402(g)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
            "$7,000 Adjusted Limit") on the amount of a participant's Savings
            Plan elective deferral contributions, (c) the $200,000 limitation
            on annual compensation, as adjusted from time to time, imposed by
            Section 401(a)(17) of such Code (the "$200,000 Adjusted Limit"),
            or (d) any limitation on benefits and contributions imposed by
            Section 415 of such Code (the "Section 415 Limits").  Therefore,
            with respect to Savings Plan elective deferral contributions which
            would have been made by a participant had the Savings Plan salary
            deferral contribution percentage actually chosen by such
            participant been applied to all of such participant's otherwise
            eligible Savings Plan compensation for the Savings Plan year
            involved (including the deferrals of base salary elected under
            this Plan) and without regard to the $7,000 or $200,000 Adjusted
            Limits or the Section 415 Limits, a special contribution equal to
            the additional employer matching contribution that would have been
            made to the Savings Plan will be credited to such participant's
            account in this Plan at the same time or times that it would have
            been credited under the Savings Plan if allowed thereunder.  An
            example of the calculation of such special contribution is shown
            on Exhibit 1 attached to and made a part of this Plan.  The
            participant shall be eligible to direct the investment of any
            special contributions hereunder in accordance with the rules
            described in Article VII.

       (4)  "Make Whole" Long-Term Disability Benefit

            It is the intent of this Plan that a participant not suffer any
            loss with respect to a disability benefit under the Long-Term
            Disability Benefit Plan applicable to employees of the Company and
            its utility subsidiaries (the "LTD Plan") because of either the
            exclusion of base salary deferred under this Plan from the
            compensation base in the LTD Plan ("Salary Deferral") or the
            $200,000 limitation on annual compensation, as adjusted from time
            to time, imposed by Section 505(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code
            (the "IRS Special Limit").  Therefore, in the event a participant
            of this Plan becomes eligible for and begins to receive a
            disability benefit from the LTD Plan and the amount of such
            disability benefit is limited because of application of Salary
            Deferral or the IRS Special Limit, a "make whole" disability
            benefit shall be paid from this Plan as a supplement to the
            disability benefit paid from the LTD Plan.  Such LTD supplement
            shall equal the monthly amount by which the participant's

                                     - 8 -
<PAGE> 10

            disability benefit under the LTD Plan was less because of
            application of Salary Deferral and the IRS Special Limit.  Such
            LTD supplement shall commence at the same time as the disability
            benefit paid under the LTD Plan and continue for so long as such
            disability benefit is paid.  All LTD supplements paid hereunder
            shall be paid out of general corporate assets or out of a grantor
            trust as provided in Article XII hereof.

X.     PLAN AMENDMENT

       The Board reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate this Plan
       at any time; provided, however, no such action will reduce the amounts
       then credited to any participant's account or change the time and
       manner of payment of the value thereof, without the consent of the
       participant, if living, or the participant's designated beneficiary or
       beneficiaries, if the participant is not living.

XI.    CLAIM PROCEDURE

       The participant or the participant's beneficiary (a "Claimant") may
       file a written request for benefits or claim with the Company under
       this Plan.  In the event of any dispute with respect to such a claim,
       the following claim procedures shall apply:

       (1)  The Company acting as the administrator for this Plan, shall
            notify the Claimant within 90 days of receipt by the Company of a
            written claim of its allowance or denial, unless the Claimant
            receives written notice from the Company prior to the end of the
            initial 90-day period indicating that special circumstances
            require an extension of time for decision.  A written notice of
            decision shall be provided to the Claimant and if the claim is
            denied in whole or in part, the notice shall contain the following
            information:  the specific reasons for the denial; specific
            reference to pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial
            is based; if applicable, a description of any additional material
            information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of
            why such information is necessary; and an explanation of the claim
            review procedure.

       (2)  A Claimant is entitled to request a review of any denial of
            his/her claim by the Board or Committee thereof.  The request for
            review must be submitted in writing within 60 days of mailing of
            notice of the denial.  Absent a request for review within the 60-
            day period, the claim will be deemed to be conclusively denied. 
            The Claimant or the Claimant's representative shall be entitled to
            review all pertinent documents, and to submit issues and comments
            orally and in writing.  The Board or Committee thereof shall
            render a review decision in writing, within 60 days after receipt
            of a request for a review, provided that, in special circumstances
            (such as the necessity of holding a hearing) the Board or
            Committee thereof may extend the time for decision by not more
            than 60 days upon written notice to the Claimant.  The Claimant
            shall receive written notice of the separate review decision of
            the Board or Committee thereof, together with specific reasons for
            the decision and reference to the pertinent provisions of this
            Plan.

       (3)  The Company, as administrator for this Plan (whether acting
            through its employees, the Board or a Committee thereof), shall

                                     - 9 -
<PAGE> 11

            have full and complete discretionary authority to construe and
            interpret this Plan and to decide any matter presented through the
            claims review procedure.  Any final determination by the
            administrator shall be binding on all parties.  If challenged in
            court, such determination shall not be subject to de novo review
            and shall not be overturned unless proven to be arbitrary and
            capricious based upon the evidence considered by the administrator
            at the time of such determination.

XII.   MISCELLANEOUS

       (1)  Neither the Company nor the participant nor any beneficiary shall
            have the power to transfer, assign, encumber, commute or
            anticipate any amounts payable hereunder.

       (2)  The Company shall have the right to withhold from any amounts
            payable hereunder any taxes or other amounts required by any
            governmental authority to be withheld.  The Company may establish
            a grantor trust to serve as a vehicle to hold such contributions
            as the Company may choose to make to pre-fund its obligations for
            benefits hereunder, but the trust shall be designed so that this
            Plan remains an unfunded plan and a participant's rights to
            benefits under this Plan shall be those of an unsecured creditor
            of the Company.

       (3)  Every person receiving or claiming payments under this Plan shall
            be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent until the date
            on which the Company receives a written notice, in form and manner
            acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent and that a
            guardian, conservator, or other person legally vested with the
            care of such person's estate has been appointed.  In the event a
            guardian or conservator of the estate of any person receiving or
            claiming payments under this Plan shall be appointed by a court of
            competent jurisdiction, payments may be made to such guardian or
            conservator provided that proper proof of appointment and
            continuing qualification is furnished in a form and manner
            acceptable to the Company.  Any such payment so made shall be a
            complete discharge of any liability therefor.

       (4)  Participation in this Plan, or any modifications thereof, or the
            payment of any benefits hereunder, shall not be construed as
            giving to the participant any right to be retained in the service
            of the Company or its subsidiaries, limiting in any way the right
            of the Company or its subsidiaries to terminate the participant's
            employment at any time, evidencing any agreement or understanding,
            express or implied, that the Company or its subsidiaries will
            employ the participant in any particular position or at any
            particular rate of compensation and/or guaranteeing the
            participant any right to receive a salary increase in any year,
            such increase being granted only at the sole discretion of the
            Board.

       (5)  The Company, or its utility subsidiaries, or their Boards of
            Directors or any committees thereof, or any officer or director of
            the Company or its utility subsidiaries or any other person shall
            not be liable for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for
            gross negligence or fraud.

               SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO SAVINGS PLAN
                                    EXAMPLE

Assumptions:  The participant will have pre-deferred compensation in 1994 of
$240,000.  The participant has signed up for a Savings Plan deferral
contribution percentage of 6% of pay.  The Savings Plan calls for an employer
match of 50% of the elective deferral contribution made by the participant up
to 6% of pay.  The participant has also elected a deferral of 15% of base
salary under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for 1994.  Article IX(3)
of the Plan requires a comparison between the actual employer matching
contribution received by the participant under the Savings Plan and the
matching contribution that would have been received, but for the deferrals
under the Plan and the application of the $7,000 and $200,000 Adjusted Limits
and the Section 415 Limits (this Example simply assumes flat $7,000 and
$200,000 limits, whereas in reality the actual adjusted limits applicable
in 1994 would apply) as follows:

                     DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

                           EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1987

                     AND AS RESTATED AS OF JANUARY 1, 1996

                         Wisconsin Energy Corporation
                         ----------------------------
                     Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan
                     ------------------------------------

I.    PURPOSE

      The purpose of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Directors' Deferred
      Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is to establish a method of paying
      directors' compensation which will aid Wisconsin Energy Corporation (the
      "Company") and its subsidiaries in attracting and retaining as members
      of their Boards of Directors persons whose abilities, experience and
      judgment can contribute to the continued progress of the Company and its
      subsidiaries.

      Effective January 1, 1996, the Wisconsin Electric Power Company
      Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan has been merged and consolidated
      with this Plan.  The Company shall maintain records to separately
      identify deferred fees that would have otherwise been paid by the
      Company and its subsidiaries.


II.   PARTICIPATION

      (A)   Definition of "Participant"

      The term "Participant" as used herein refers to any former, present or
      future member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a subsidiary
      of the Company (the "Director") who shall by election become subject to
      this Plan.

      (B)   Election By Directors

      Any Director who is not also an officer or employee of the Company or of
      a subsidiary of the Company may elect to have fees otherwise payable to
      such Director for service as a Director retained by the Company and paid
      in accordance with the Plan, effective on the first day of the calendar
      month following the date of acknowledgement of receipt of such election. 
      Such election shall be made by notice in writing mailed or delivered to
      the Secretary of the Company.  The fees which the Director has elected
      to defer shall thereafter be retained by the Company until a written
      notice of termination signed by Participant has been mailed or delivered
      to the Secretary of the Company.  A notice of termination of
      authorization to retain such fees will be effective as to those fees
      payable in the calendar month subsequent to the month in which such
      notice of termination was received and acknowledged by the Secretary of
      the Company but will have no force or effect on any fees retained by the
      Company in the month such notice of termination was mailed or delivered
      or any prior months, or on the dispersal of fees retained in the month
      such notice of termination was mailed or delivered or in any prior
      months.


III.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS

      An amount equivalent to the fees which the Director has elected to defer
      and which have been retained by the Company under Paragraph II, shall be
      credited to an account on the books of the Company, to be designated as


                                     - 1 -
<PAGE> 3

      the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account (the "Account"), at the
      time the fees would have been payable had Participant not agreed to have
      the fees retained by the Company.  The Account to which such retained
      fees are credited shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets
      of Company and shall be treated as any other account payable on the
      books of the Company.  Participant shall have no interest in the
      Account, which is established merely as an accounting convenience and
      which shall not operate to segregate any balance therein from the
      general assets of the Company.  The Company may establish a grantor
      trust to serve as a vehicle to hold amounts credited to the Accounts
      established hereunder, but the trust shall be designed so that this Plan
      remains an unfunded plan and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have
      any rights other than those of an unsecured creditor.


IV.   EARNINGS ON DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

      (A)   Each Participant may elect to have the Participant's Account
            invested in the Interest Rate Fund or WEC Stock Fund as described
            below:

            (1)   Interest Rate Fund.  Under this method, earnings shall be
                  credited on the average balance in each Account determined
                  by averaging the beginning and ending balance of such
                  Account within the period intervening since interest was
                  last credited to the Account (except, in the case of a new
                  Participant, within the period from the effective date a
                  Director becomes a Participant to the end of the next
                  June 30 or December 31 or the date such Participant
                  terminates participation, whichever is earlier) and shall be
                  credited to the Account semiannually, each year, until all
                  distributions to which Participant, Participant's estate or
                  Beneficiary is entitled shall have been made.  Whenever a
                  lump sum amount or final distribution is made as of a date
                  other than June 30 or December 31, interest shall be
                  credited to the Account as of such payment date.  The rate
                  of interest shall be the prime commercial rate as published
                  by Firstar Bank, Milwaukee, N.A. in effect on the last day
                  of the period, except for any period in which any lump sum
                  amount or final distribution from an Account is made as of a
                  date other than the end of the period, in which case the
                  rate of interest shall be the prime commercial rate as
                  published by Firstar Bank, Milwaukee, N.A. in effect on the
                  date interest was last credited as determined above.

            (2)   WEC Stock Fund.  Under this method, earnings shall be
                  credited at a rate which reflects the performance of
                  Wisconsin Energy Corporation common stock ("WEC stock"). 
                  The value of the Participant's Account in the WEC Stock Fund
                  shall be determined by taking into account changes in the
                  value of WEC stock, dividends paid on WEC stock and any
                  changes in the capital structure of the Company affecting
                  the value of WEC stock.

      (B)  Investment of Deferrals

      The Participant's deferral election shall identify the Fund or Funds in
      which the deferrals shall be invested and may be in 10% increments.


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE> 4

      (C)  Investment Transfer
      
      In accordance with rules established by the Company, a Participant may
      make a one-time election to transfer all or part of the Participant's
      Account in the Interest Rate Fund to the WEC Stock Fund.


V.    PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS

      (A)   No Payment during Tenure

      None of the amounts including interest credited to the Account shall be
      paid to Participant as long as Participant serves as a Director of the
      Company or as a Director of any of the Company's subsidiaries.

      (B)   Normal Payment Method

      Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs VI and VII hereof, as of the
      first business day of the sixth calendar month subsequent to the month
      in which the later of the following events occurs, (i) Participant's
      service as a Director with the Company terminates for any reason other
      than death, (ii) Participant's service as a Director with all of the
      Company's subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than death, or
      (iii) Participant attains the mandatory retirement age for Directors
      under Board policy, the Company shall pay to Participant, if Participant
      be living, one-tenth (1/10th) of the amount credited to the Account as
      of said payment date (the "principal amount") and as of the first
      business day of each January thereafter, one-tenth (1/10th) of the
      principal amount and in addition thereto any interest credited to the
      Account in the period intervening since the last payment until a total
      of ten payments have been made.  Such ten payments, regardless of the
      total amount thereof, shall constitute full payment of all amounts due
      Participant under this Plan.

      (C)   Alternate Payment Methods

      Upon written application of Participant made prior to the termination of
      such Participant's service as a Director (which application shall be
      irrevocable during the Participant's lifetime if approved by the
      Company), and subject to the approval of the Company in its sole
      discretion upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, the
      Company may allow the following alternate payment methods:

      (1)   Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs VI and VII hereof, as of
            the first business day of the sixth calendar month subsequent to
            the month in which the later of the following events occurs, (i)
            Participant's service as a Director with the Company terminates
            for any reason other than death, (ii) Participant's service as a
            Director with all of the Company's subsidiaries terminates for any
            reason other than death, or (iii) Participant attains the
            mandatory retirement age for Directors under Board policy, the
            Company shall pay to Participant, if Participant be living, one-
            tenth (1/10th) of the amount credited to the Account as of said
            payment date (the "principal amount") and as of the first business
            day of each January thereafter, that portion of the amount
            credited to the Account as of said payment date which is
            determined by multiplying said Account balance by a fraction the
            numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE> 5


            number of years of distribution remaining until a total of ten
            payments have been made.  Such ten payments, regardless of the
            total amount thereof, shall constitute full payment of all amounts
            due Participant under this Plan.

      (A)   Normal Payment Method

      In the event of Participant's death, annual payments will be made to
      Participant's Beneficiary (as hereinafter defined), provided that the
      Beneficiary is alive at the time such payments are to be made, in the
      following manner:

      (1)   If Participant dies while still serving as a Director of the
            Company or as a Director of any of the Company's subsidiaries, the
            payments will be in the same amount and payable at the same time
            as the payments which would have otherwise been payable to
            Participant had Participant's service to the Company as a Director
            terminated on the date of Participant's death under the conditions
            precedent for distribution described in Paragraph V(B) and had
            Participant been alive until the ten payments had been paid under
            Paragraph V(B).

      (2)   If Participant dies after such service has terminated and while
            Participant is receiving payments under Paragraph V, the payments,
            if any, will be in the same amount and payable at the same time as
            if Participant had been alive until the ten payments had been paid
            under Paragraph V(B).

      (3)   If Participant dies after such service has terminated, but before
            payment had commenced under Paragraph V(B), the payments will be
            in the same amount and payable at the same time as the payments


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE> 6

            which would have otherwise been payable to Participant had
            Participant's service as a Director terminated on the date of
            Participant's death under the conditions precedent for
            distribution described in Paragraph V(B) and had Participant been
            alive until the ten payments had been paid under Paragraph V(B).

      (B)   Alternate Payment Methods

      Upon written application of Participant's Beneficiary made prior to the
      time any distribution under this Plan is payable to said Beneficiary
      (which application shall be irrevocable if approved by the Company), and
      subject to the approval of the Company in its sole discretion upon such
      terms and conditions as it may determine, forms of payment as provided
      in Paragraph V(C) may be made in lieu of the payments in Paragraph
      VI(A).

      (C)   Payment in the Event of Beneficiary's Death

      If the last Beneficiary who survives Participant shall die before
      receiving the full amount payable hereunder, then the balance of the
      Account not paid shall be paid in a lump sum to the estate of such
      Beneficiary within six months after Company has been notified of such
      death.

      (D)   Definition and Designation of Beneficiary

      The term "Beneficiary" as used herein includes the plural and means any
      person(s), including corporate or individual persons, designated by
      Participant in a written instrument filed with the Secretary of the
      Company.  Participant may designate a primary beneficiary and, in the
      event of the death of the primary beneficiary, a contingent beneficiary. 
      The right is reserved to Participant to change the person or persons
      designated as Beneficiary, by filing with the Secretary of the Company a
      written notice of change in Beneficiary, and any such change shall not
      require the consent of the Beneficiary.

      (E)   Payment in the Event no Beneficiary is Designated

      If Participant has failed to designate a Beneficiary in a written
      instrument filed with the Secretary of the Company, or if the
      Beneficiary predeceases Participant, then the balance of the Account not
      paid shall be paid in a lump sum amount to Participant's estate within
      six months after Company has been notified of Participant's death.

      (F)   Date of Payment

      In all cases under any payment method, actual payment of the amounts due
      shall be made within five business days after the determined payment
      date.

      (G)  Cash Distributions 

      All Distributions under the Plan shall be in cash.

      promptly pay each Participant and each Beneficiary receiving benefits a
      single lump sum equal to the amount credited to the Participant's

      to whether the Participant is still serving as a Director of the Company
      or any of its affiliates), in lieu of whatever other method of payment,
      if any, had been elected or placed into effect.  Any amount credited the
      Participant's Account in the WEC Stock Fund shall be distributed in a
      single lump sum immediately following the Participant's termination of
      service.


VIII. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

      The Company shall have the right to retain from payments payable to
      Participant, Participant's estate or Beneficiary amounts required by any
      government to be withheld and paid to such government with respect to
      such payment.

                            INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION

            3.    METHOD OF EXERCISE
                  ------------------

This option may be exercised only by appropriate notice in writing delivered

                  reasonably request in order to comply with securities, tax

                  or other laws then applicable to the exercise of the option.


Payment of the purchase price may be made in whole or in part by the delivery

of shares of Common Stock owned by the Employee (or by certification of the

Employee's ownership of such shares), valued at fair market value on the date

                  --------------------------

            This option is not transferable by the Employee otherwise than by

will or the laws of descent and distribution and is exercisable during the

Employee's lifetime only by the Employee.  If the Employee dies during the

option period, this option may be exercised in whole or in part and from time

to time, in the manner described in paragraph 3 hereof, by the Employee's

estate or the person to whom the option passes by will or the laws of descent

are required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") or any

state securities laws, or that delivery of the shares must be accompanied or

preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirements of that Act or such state

securities laws, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the

registration or provide the prospectus not later than a reasonable time

following each exercise of this option, but delivery of shares by the Company

may be deferred until the registration is effected or the prospectus is

available.  The Employee shall have no interest in shares covered by this

option until certificates for the shares are issued, or in lieu of

certificates, shares are credited to the Employee's account in the book-entry

form.


            6.    ADJUSTMENTS
                  -----------

            If the Company shall at any time change the number of shares of

its Common Stock without new consideration to the Company (such as by stock

dividend, stock split or similar transaction), the total number of shares then

remaining subject to purchase hereunder shall be changed in proportion to the

change in issued shares and the option price per share shall be adjusted so

that the total consideration payable to the Company upon the purchase of all

shares not theretofore purchased shall not be changed.  If during the term of

this option the Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into another kind

of stock or into securities of another corporation, cash, evidence of

indebtedness, other property or any combination thereof (the "Acquisition

Consideration"), whether as a result of reorganization, sale, merger,

consolidation, or other similar transaction, the Company shall cause adequate

provision to be made whereby the Employee shall thereafter be entitled to

receive upon the due exercise of this option the Acquisition Consideration the

Employee would have been entitled to receive for Common Stock acquired through

exercise of this option immediately prior to the effective date of such

transaction.

Employee's death or (b) ten years from the date hereof, whichever period is

shorter.


            5.    REGISTRATION
                  ------------

            If at any time during the option period the Company shall be

securities laws, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the

registration or provide the prospectus not later than a reasonable time

following each exercise of this option, but delivery of shares by the Company

change in issued shares and the option price per share shall be adjusted so

that the total consideration payable to the Company upon the purchase of all

this option the Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into another kind

of stock or into securities of another corporation, cash, evidence of

provision to be made whereby the Employee shall thereafter be entitled to

receive upon the due exercise of this option the Acquisition Consideration the

exercise of this option immediately prior to the effective date of such

transaction.


            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused the execution hereof by

its duly authorized officer and Employee has agreed to the terms and

             INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AND CONTINGENT DIVIDEND AWARD
             ----------------------------------------------------


            THIS INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION, dated the 20th day of December 1995,

                  ----------------

            This option may be exercised (in the manner described in paragraph

3 hereof) in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, subject to

the following limitations:


            (a)   This option may not be exercised to any extent until

December 20, 1999, at which time it will become fully exercisable.  However,

in the event that the Employee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary

terminates by reason of retirement, permanent total disability or death prior

to December 20, 1999, then this option shall become fully exercisable upon

such termination.  In addition, this option shall become fully exercisable

upon a Change of Control of the Company as defined in paragraph 11 of the Plan

except notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, none of the

Merger, dated as of April 28, 1995, as amended and restated as of July 26,

1995 by and among Northern States Power Company, Wisconsin Energy Corporation,

Northern Power Wisconsin Corp., and WEC Sub Corp., shall constitute a Change

in Control for purposes of the Plan. 


            (b)   This option may not be exercised:

                  (i)   more than three months after the termination of the

                        Employee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary

                        for any reason other than retirement, permanent total

                        disability or death; or


                  (ii)  more than twelve months after termination of

                        death; or


                  (iii) more than three years after termination of employment

                        by retirement; or


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE> 13

                  (iv)  more than ten years from the date hereof.


            For these purposes retirement and permanent total disability shall

            be determined in accordance with the established policies of the

            Company applicable to officers and other key employees.


            3.    METHOD OF EXERCISE
                  ------------------

This option may be exercised only by appropriate notice in writing delivered

to the Secretary of the Company and accompanied by:


            (a)   a check payable to the order of the Company for the full

                  purchase price of the shares purchased, and


            (b)   such other documents or representations as the Company may

                  reasonably request in order to comply with securities, tax

                  or other laws then applicable to the exercise of the option.


Payment of the purchase price may be made in whole or in part by the delivery

of shares of Common Stock owned by the Employee (or by certification of the

Employee's ownership of such shares), valued at fair market value on the date

of exercise.  Shares acquired in a prior option exercise may not be used for

this purpose until the shares have been held by the Employee for six months.


            4.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY; DEATH
                  --------------------------

            This option is not transferable by the Employee otherwise than by

will or the laws of descent and distribution and is exercisable during the

Employee's lifetime only by the Employee.  If the Employee dies during the

option period, this option may be exercised in whole or in part and from time

to time, in the manner described in paragraph 3 hereof, by the Employee's

estate or the person to whom the option passes by will or the laws of descent





                                     - 3 -

Employee's death or (b) ten years from the date hereof, whichever period is

shorter.


            5.    REGISTRATION
                  ------------

            If at any time during the option period the Company shall be

advised by its counsel that shares deliverable upon exercise of the option are

required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") or any

state securities laws, or that delivery of the shares must be accompanied or

preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirements of that Act or such state

securities laws, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the

registration or provide the prospectus not later than a reasonable time

following each exercise of this option, but delivery of shares by the Company

may be deferred until the registration is effected or the prospectus is

option until certificates for the shares are issued, or in lieu of

certificates, shares are credited to the Employee's account in the book-entry

form.


            6.    ADJUSTMENTS
                  -----------

            If the Company shall at any time change the number of shares of

its Common Stock without new consideration to the Company (such as by stock

dividend, stock split or similar transaction), the total number of shares then

remaining subject to purchase hereunder shall be changed in proportion to the

change in issued shares and the option price per share shall be adjusted so

that the total consideration payable to the Company upon the purchase of all

shares not theretofore purchased shall not be changed.  If during the term of

this option the Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into another kind

of stock or into securities of another corporation, cash, evidence of



                                     - 4 -

Consideration"), whether as a result of reorganization, sale, merger,

consolidation, or other similar transaction, the Company shall cause adequate

provision to be made whereby the Employee shall thereafter be entitled to

receive upon the due exercise of this option the Acquisition Consideration the

Employee would have been entitled to receive for Common Stock acquired through

exercise of this option immediately prior to the effective date of such

transaction.


            7.    CONTINGENT DIVIDEND AWARD
                  -------------------------

            The company hereby grants to the Employee a contingent dividend

award on a number of shares equal to the number of shares covered by this

option agreement, entitling the Employee to receive the equivalent of the cash

dividends that would have been paid over a four-year period commencing

December 20, 1995 (the Performance Period) on such shares, providing the

conditions set forth herein are satisfied.


            A contingent dividend award will only be payable if the Company

achieves a total shareholder return over the Performance Period that is equal

to or exceeds the median return earned by the companies in the Company's

industry peer group, except that there will be no payout if the Company's

total shareholder return is negative over the Performance Period.  No interest

is payable on amounts accumulated with respect to the contingent dividend

award prior to payment.  The contingent dividend award will be forfeited if

the Employee does not remain in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary

through the end of the Performance Period.

securities laws, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the

Employee would have been entitled to receive for Common Stock acquired through

exercise of this option immediately prior to the effective date of such

transaction.


            7.    CONTINGENT DIVIDEND AWARD
                  -------------------------

Mr. Calvin H. Baker
1660 N. Prospect Ave., Apt 312
Milwaukee, WI 53202

Dear Cal:

                      RE:  SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS
                           ---------------------

This letter agreement replaces in its entirety the letter agreement between us
dated September 3, 1991 and signed by you on September 3, 1991.

In consideration of your service with Wisconsin Electric Power Company
(hereinafter called the Company) and your agreement to devote your individual
best efforts to the interest of said Company in the future, it is agreed that
supplemental benefits as described in this Agreement will be provided by the
Company.

Retirement
- ----------

Upon your retirement at age 60 or older (or prior to age 60 with the approval
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the Company), the
Company will pay a supplemental monthly retirement benefit equal to the
difference between (1) and (2) below, less the amount of the monthly vested
retirement benefits payable to you at age 65 under defined benefit plans from
previous employers for periods of employment prior to your employment by the
Company, where (1) and (2) are defined as follows:

(1)   equals the monthly retirement benefit payable from the Management
      Employees' Retirement Plan of the Company or such successor Plans as may
      be adopted by the Company (hereinafter called the Plan) plus the amounts
      of any actual "make whole" pension supplements due under the provisions
      of Section IX(1) and (2) of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Executive
      Deferred Compensation Plan, plus any amount payable under Monthly
      Benefit A under the Wisconsin Energy Corporation Supplemental Executive
      Retirement Plan, and

(2)   equals the monthly retirement benefit which would have been payable from
      the Plan calculated without regard to any limitations imposed by
      Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code or any limitation on annual
      compensation, as adjusted from time to time, imposed by
      Section 401(a)(17) of such Code and under the assumptions that (i) your
      participation in the Plan had commenced on the first day of the month
      following your twenty-fifth birthday and continued uninterrupted
      thereafter, (ii) any deferrals of base salary you elected under the
      Wisconsin Energy Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan were
      disregarded and instead included in your compensation base for
      calculating retirement income under the Plan, and (iii) the amount of
      any Performance Award, Incentive Award or special award, calculated at
      the time of its determination by the Board of Wisconsin Energy
      Corporation had also been included in your compensation base for
      calculating retirement income under the Plan.
<PAGE> 2

Mr. Calvin H. Baker
November 21, 1994
Page 2


The reduction amount with respect to benefits payable to you at age 65 under
defined benefit plans from previous employers shall be converted into an
actuarial equivalent of a Life Annuity Form payable at age 65 using the
actuarial equivalency factors under the Plan, but shall be subtracted, without
any further adjustment, from any supplemental monthly retirement benefit
calculated as above set forth whenever the same commences whether before or
after your 65th birthday.  Further, such reduction amount applies to any
supplemental monthly retirement benefit calculated as above set forth and
expressed as a Life Annuity Form of benefit and shall be made prior to the
application of factors applicable for any other form of benefit available
under the provisions of the Plan.  Prior to the time of retirement, you will
provide the Company with certified information regarding any such defined
benefit retirement benefits payable or to be payable to you by a previous
employer.

Preretirement Spouse's Benefit
- ------------------------------

In the event of your death while in the employ of the Company, the Company
will pay to your surviving spouse (if any) a monthly benefit equal to the
difference between (a) and (b) below, but reduced as provided below to reflect
the value of any vested defined benefit retirement benefits attributable to
prior employment as set forth under the "Retirement" paragraph of this letter,
where (a) and (b) are defined as follows:

      (a) equals the monthly spouse's benefit, if any, payable from the Plan
      plus the amounts of any actual "make whole" spousal pension supplements
      due under the provisions of Section IX(1) and (2) of the Wisconsin
      Energy Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, plus any amount
      payable under Monthly Benefit A under the Wisconsin Energy Corporation
      Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, and

      (b) equals the monthly spouse's benefit which would have been payable
      from the Plan calculated on all the same assumptions as set forth in
      subsection (2) of the "Retirement" paragraph of this letter.

The reduction amount with respect to vested defined benefit retirement
benefits attributable to prior employment is to be applied by reducing the
monthly surviving spouse benefit calculated as above set forth by one-half of
the dollar amount of the vested benefit which would have been offset under the
"Retirement" paragraph of this letter.

Condition of Payment
- --------------------

All of the terms and conditions of the supplemental benefits provided herein
shall be subject to and shall be administered as if such supplemental benefits
were payable directly from the Plan.  No supplemental benefits, other than
those specifically provided herein, shall be paid by the Company upon your
termination of employment with the Company for any other reasons.

Mr. Calvin H. Baker

The form of your supplemental benefits will follow the form payable to you
from the Plan.  However, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, you may
at the time of your retirement make a written request to the Board of
Directors of the Company for a single lump sum payment of an amount equal to
the then present value of all supplemental benefits accrued under this letter
agreement, calculated using (i) an interest rate equal to the five-year
United States Treasury Note yield in effect on the last business day of the
month prior to the payment (as reported in the Wall Street Journal or
comparable publication), and (ii) the mortality tables then in use under the
Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may grant or deny such request.

Further, upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" of Wisconsin Energy
Corporation (as defined in Exhibit A attached to and made a part of this
letter), then notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company shall
promptly pay to you or to anyone then receiving supplemental benefits under
this letter agreement a single lump sum payment of an amount equal to the then
present value of all such supplemental benefits accrued (whether or not in pay
status and without regard to whether your employment is continuing),
calculated using the same assumptions as set forth in the immediately
preceding paragraph, with an interest rate to equal the five-year
United States Treasury Note yield in effect on the last business day of the
month prior to the date when the Change in Control occurred.  If you continue
in employment and the supplemental benefits provided for in this letter
continue, appropriate provisions shall be made so that any subsequent payments
under this letter agreement are reduced to reflect the value of such lump sum
payment.

All amounts payable under this letter agreement shall be subject to all
applicable withholding taxes.  The Company or its parent may establish a
grantor trust to serve as a vehicle to hold such contributions as the Company
may choose to make to pre-fund its obligations hereunder, but the trust shall
be designed so that this letter agreement remains an unfunded arrangement and
your rights to benefits under this letter agreement shall be those of an
unsecured creditor.

If the terms of this agreement are satisfactory to you, please indicate your
acceptance below.

Sincerely,

WISCONSIN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY

                                   EXHIBIT A


                         Change in Control Definition



      For purposes of this Plan, a "change in control" with respect to
Wisconsin Energy Corporation (the "Corporation") shall mean the occurrence of
any of the following events, as a result of one transaction or a series of
transactions:

            (a)   any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
                  and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but
                  excluding the Corporation, its affiliates and any qualified
                  or non-qualified plan maintained by the Corporation or its
                  affiliates) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
                  Rule 13d-3 promulgated under such Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing
                  more than 20% of the combined voting power of the
                  Corporation's then outstanding securities;

            (b)   individuals who constitute a majority of the Board of
                  Directors of the Corporation immediately prior to a
                  contested election for positions on the Board cease to
                  constitute a majority as a result of such contested
                  election;

            (c)   the Corporation is combined (by merger, share exchange,
                  consolidation, or otherwise) with another corporation and as
                  a result of such combination, less than 60% of the
                  outstanding securities of the surviving or resulting
                  corporation are owned in the aggregate by the former
                  shareholders of the Corporation;

            (d)   the Corporation sells, leases, or otherwise transfers all or
                  substantially all of its properties or assets not in the
                  ordinary course of business to another person or entity; or

            (e)   the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines in its
                  sole and absolute discretion that there has been a Change in
                  Control of the Corporation.

      These Change in Control provisions shall apply to successive Changes in
Control on an individual transaction basis.
