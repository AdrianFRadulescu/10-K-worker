UNITED TELEPHONE COMPANY OF OHIO
Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K, Part I, December 31, 1993



Item 1.     Business

     United Telephone Company of Ohio (Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sprint Corporation (Sprint), was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Ohio in 1965 and subsequently succeeded by acquisition or merger to the business
of several other telephone operating companies in Ohio.

     In 1990, the Company combined its administrative offices with United
Telephone Company of Indiana, Inc. (United of Indiana), an affiliate.  Each
company retains a separate legal identity.

     The Company is engaged in the business of furnishing communications
services consisting mainly of local and long-distance services and network
access.  It provides service to 507,111 access lines in 164 exchange areas.  No
other company furnishes local telephone service in any of the exchange areas
served by the Company.


     Revenues from telephone and other communications services constitute about
91% of the Company's total operating revenues.  The remaining 9% of total
operating revenues is, in large part, contributed by directory advertising,
billing and collection services, operator services, facility leases, and non-
regulated sales.  A significant portion of the Company's network access revenues
are derived from access charge billings to AT&T Communications, Inc. (AT&T).


     The Company's operating area includes approximately 8,700 square miles or
21% of the geographical area of the State of Ohio and contains approximately 10%
of the State's population.  Approximately 34% of the Company's 507,111 access
lines in service are located in the five exchange areas of Warren, Mansfield,
Lima, Wooster and Mount Vernon.  The service areas contain a variety of both
large and commercial and agricultural businesses.


     In addition to furnishing local service, the Company's central offices and
long-distance lines are connected with other independent telephone companies and
with the nationwide long-distance networks of interexchange carriers, primarily
AT&T.  Long-distance calls may thus be made to any telephone in the United
States and most other countries.  Other telecommunications services, for the
most part furnished in conjunction with other telephone companies, include
facilities for private line service, data transmission, mobile radio telephone
and wide area long-distance service.

     The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries.  United Telephone
Communications Services of Ohio, Inc. offers terminal equipment and inside
wire leasing and maintenance services to the residential and business markets.
United Telephone Long Distance, Inc.  offers one-plus, interLATA long-distance
service.

    On December 31, 1993, the Company had 2,767 employees, of which 1,315
employees are members of either the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers or the Communications Workers of America.  The remaining
employees of the Company are not represented by any collective bargaining unit.

    Compliance with federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of
the environment has had no material effect upon capital expenditures or earnings
of the Company, and future effects are not expected to be significant.

     Effective January 1, 1991, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
adopted a price caps regulatory format for the Regional Bell Operating Companies
and the GTE local exchange companies.  Other local exchange companies
(LECs) could volunteer to become subject to the price caps regulation.  Under
price caps, prices for access service must be adjusted annually to reflect
industry average productivity gains (as specified by the FCC), inflation and
certain allowed cost changes.  The Company elected to be subject to price caps
regulation, and under the form of the plan adopted, the Company has an
opportunity to earn up to a 14.25 percent rate of return on investment.

     The potential for more direct competition with LECs is increasing.  At the
state level, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) was challenged in
1990 with responding to the issue of franchise boundaries for LECs.  The PUCO
was requested in two separate cases to rule on whether a LEC can provide dial
tone service to a customer located in the franchise territory of a different
LEC.  The PUCO has not ruled on this issue but will be pressured to do so as the
future of the local exchange franchise continues to be questioned and as it is
faced with competition as a result of technological advancements.

                                                               Form 10-K,Part I
                                                               December 31, 1993

Item 1.     Business (continued)

     The PUCO also continued to debate extended area service (EAS) in 1993
regarding the definition of more stringent guidelines for specific EAS requests.
A generic docket is before the PUCO but has not been ruled upon.  In the
meantime, the PUCO has continued to rule in favor of extended local calling (a
measured form of EAS), as recommended by the Company (resulting in the cost
causer being the cost payer), rather than traditional flat rate EAS.

     At the interstate level, the FCC has revised its rules to permit connection
of customer-owned coin telephones to the local network, exposing LECs to direct
coin telephone competition in many states.  Additionally, the FCC has assisted
Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) in providing access to interexchange
carriers and end users by mandating that all Tier 1 LECs (including the Company)
allow collocation of CAP equipment in LEC central offices.  The FCC's decision
regarding collocation is under appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit.  In October 1992, the FCC adopted a new rate structure and new pricing
rules for LEC-provided switched transport.  It is considered an interim rate
structure (approximately two years) while the FCC determines a long-term 
structure.  Rates were developed such that the impact of this new rate structure
will be revenue-neutral for the Company.  The new rates went into effect on
December 30, 1993.

     The extent and ultimate impact of competition on the Company will continue
to depend, to a considerable degree, on FCC and PUCO actions, court decisions 
and possible federal or state legislation.  Legislation designed to stimulate
local competition between local exchange service providers and cable programming
service providers, in both markets, is presently pending in both houses of the
U.S. Congress.

Item 2.     Properties

     The properties of the Company consist principally of land, structures,
facilities and equipment used in providing telephone service and are in
good operating condition.  Substantially all of the telephone properties are
subject to the lien securing the Company's first mortgage bonds.

     Of the Company's investment in telephone plant in service as of December 
31, 1993, central office equipment represented approximately 37%; cable and wire
facilities, 45%; telephone instruments and related equipment installed on 
subscribers' premises, 4%; land and buildings, 6%; and other telephone plant,
8%.

     The following table shows gross additions to, and retirements of,
properties of the Company for each of the years in the five year period ended
December 31, 1993 (in thousands of dollars):

      The Registrant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint, and consequently 
its common stock is not traded.

Item 6.     Selected Financial Data

      The table set forth below presents significant financial data for each of
the years in the five year period ended December 31, 1993 (in thousands of
dollars):

                                 1993       1992       1991      1990      1989

Operating Revenues            $398,089   $371,806   $351,973  $343,005  $343,328

Net Income (1)                $ 34,741   $ 42,896   $ 41,238   $40,969  $ 41,777

Total Assets                  $628,839   $596,282   $575,721  $557,214  $552,282

(excludes current maturities)

(1)   During 1993, nonrecurring charges of $12.8 million were recorded 
representing the Company's portion of the costs associated with the merger of 
Sprint and Centel Corporation.  Such charges reduced 1993 net income by $8.3 
million.

      Earnings and dividend per share information has been omitted because the 
Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint.

Item 7.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
            Results of Operations

Recent Development - Sprint/Centel Merger

      Effective March 9, 1993, Sprint consummated its merger with Centel
Corporation, a telecommunications company with local exchange and 
cellular/wireless communications services operations (see Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information).  The 
transaction costs associated with the merger (consisting primarily of 
investment banking and legal fees) and the estimated expenses of integrating 
and restructuring the operations of the two companies (consisting primarily of 
employee severance and relocation expenses and costs of eliminating duplicative 
facilities) resulted in a nonrecurring charge to Sprint during 1993.  The 
portion of such charge attributable to the Company was $12.8 million, which
reduced 1993 net income by approximately $8.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

      During 1993, cash from operating activities exceeded capital expenditures
by $2.8 million, continuing to indicate the Company's strong liquidity and 
financial position.  The Company maintains its commitment to provide its 
subscribers the most technologically advanced telecommunications equipment.
Accordingly, the Company continually replaces and constructs new facilities, and
the 1993 construction program continued that emphasis.  The actual expenditures
for property, plant and equipment were $74.6 million in 1993, $76.9 million in
1992, and $76.1 million in 1991.  The planned construction expenditures in 1994
are expected to approximate $77.1 million, as the increasing demand for 
interexchange access services requires the placement of high-capacity fiber 
optic facilities.  The Company anticipates that the funds for this program will 
be supplied by operating activities and short-term borrowings.
      
      The demand for telephone services is relatively constant and usually
generates a non-cyclical cash in-flow.  During 1993, operating activities
generated cash of $77.4 million, compared to $111.1 million in 1992 and $109.4
million in 1991.  The decrease from 1992 to 1993 is attributable to increased
accounts receivable, decreased accounts payable, and expenditures related to
merger and restructuring costs.

      Adequate depreciation rates remain critical to the Company due to the 
large investment in telecommunications plant and equipment.  To ensure the 
timely recovery of capital, the Company has historically sought to obtain
higher depreciation rates from the PUCO.  Effective January 1, 1989, the PUCO
allowed a maximum ten-year period for amortizing a depreciation 
reserve deficiency of $54.5 million, and gave the Company the option to 
accelerate the amortization for book purposes. Included in depreciation expense 
for 1993, 1992 and 1991 is amortization of $5.4 million each year.  At December 
31, 1993, $26.1 million of the reserve deficiency remains to beamortized at a 
minimum of $5.4 million annually.

      Net cash used by financing activities was $4.3 million. The Company issued
$40 million of First Mortgage Bonds, Series CC, due January 1, 2000.  The 
proceeds from this issuance were used to repay advances from the parent
company of $30 million, which were classified as long-term debt, and to fund
capital construction.  The Company early retired $76.0 million in long-term debt
in 1993 with interest rates ranging from 6.875 percent to 9.0 percent.  These
retirements were refinanced on a long-term basis with the issuance of Series DD,
due June 1, 2000 for $30 million and Series EE, due June 1, 2005 for $35 million
at rates of 6.5 percent and 7.25 percent, respectively.  No dividends were 
declared in 1993.

      At December 31, 1993, the composition of the Company's capital structure
was 61.4 percent common equity and 38.6 percent long-term debt. This compares to
a year-end capital structure comprised of 57.6 percent common equity and 42.4 
percent long-term debt in 1992.

Results of Operations

      Operating revenues consist of local service, network access, long-distance
network and miscellaneous.  Local service revenues are derived from providing
local telephone exchange services and leasing equipment.  Network access 
revenues are derived from billing other carriers and telephone customers for 
their use of the local network to complete long-distance calls in those 
instances where the long-distance service is not provided by the Company.  Long-
distance revenues are derived principally from providing long-distance services 
within designated areas.  Miscellaneous revenues primarily relate to directory 
advertising, billing and collection services for interexchange carriers, 
operator services, network facility leases and sales of telecommunications 
equipment.

      Operating revenues in 1993 increased by $26.3 million or 7.1 percent from
1992.  This increase in total operating revenues was universal to all revenue
categories during the year.

      Access lines in 1993 grew by 17,785 or 3.6 percent compared to 1992.  This
growth trend was reflected in a 3.9 percent growth in local service revenue.
Basic subscriber line revenue increased $4.6 million or 3.8 percent.

      Network access revenue increased by $9.7 million or 7.7 percent for the
year ended December 31, 1993 compared to 1992.  Increased usage, as indicated by
a 5.0 percent growth in message volumes and a 7.2 percent growth in minutes of
use, accounted for the increase.

      Long distance network revenue increased $4.8 million or 8.7 percent for 
the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to 1992.  The increase can be  
attributed to increased volumes of messages and minutes of use in the current 
year.

      Other revenues increased $5.6 million or 17.8 percent for the year ended
December 31, 1993 compared to 1992.  Sales of telecommunication equipment
increased $4.1 million due to increased sales of structured wire and PBX
systems.  Increased revenues from providing operator services also contributed
to the increase.

      Operating expenses (including taxes) increased $34.0 million or 10.7
percent in 1993 compared to 1992.  The major components of the current year's
increase were increases in plant expense, customer operations, and merger, 
integration and restructuring costs.

      Plant expense increased $7.4 million or 6.7 percent.  Repairs of buried
cable increased $1.4 million due to the implementation of a new preventive cable
maintenance program.  General purpose computer and generic software expense
increased $1.7 million resulting from increased purchases from Northern Telecom
for central office switch conversions.  Other plant nonspecific expenses
increased $1.6 million, including network operations and access expense.  Other
increases in plant expense occurred in rearrangement and change activity.

      Customer operations expense increased $8.3 million or 20.6 percent for the
year ended December 31, 1993.  Sales and advertising expense increased $4.2
million in the current year as the Company continues to intensify its efforts
to achieve increased market share in today's competitive environment.  Call
completion, number services, and business operations expense increased $1.7
million which is directly related to the increase in revenues derived from
providing operator services.

Item 7     Management's Discussion (continued)


      Merger, integration and restructuring costs were $12.8 million in 1993 as
discussed above.

      Other operating expense was $4.1 million higher in 1993 when compared to
1992 due to an increase of $4.0 million in cost of equipment sales.

      In addition to the increases discussed above, plant expense, customer
operations expense and corporate operations expense also increased as a result 
of higher postretirement benefits costs due to the adoption of Statement of 
Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The incremental cost associated with this change
in accounting principle was approximately $6,550,000.

Effects of Inflation

      The effects of inflation on the operations of the Company were not
significant during 1993, 1992 or 1991.

Recent Accounting Developments

       Effective January 1, 1994, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" (see Note 1 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for
additional information).

      Consistent with most local exchange carriers, the Company accounts for the
economic effects of regulation pursuant to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."  The application of SFAS No. 71
requires the accounting recognition of the rate actions of regulators where
appropriate, including the recognition of depreciation based on estimated useful
lives prescribed by regulatory commissions rather than those which might be
utilized by non-regulated enterprises.  The Company's management believes that
the Company's operations meet the criteria for the continued application of the
provisions of SFAS No. 71.  With increasing competition and the changing nature
of regulation in the telecommunications industry, the ongoing applicability of
SFAS No. 71 must, however, be constantly monitored and evaluated.  Should the
Company no longer qualify for the application of the provisions of SFAS No. 71 
at some future date, the accounting impact could result in the recognition of a
material, extraordinary, non-cash charge.

                           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS






The Board of Directors 
United Telephone Company of Ohio



      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Telephone Company of Ohio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint Corporation, as 
of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993.  Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a)2.  These
financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedules based on our audits.              

      We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United 
Telephone Company of Ohio at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, 
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

      As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, United
Telephone Company of Ohio changed its method of accounting for postretirement
benefits in 1993.

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  December 31, 1993




1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES


     United Telephone Company of Ohio is engaged in the business of providing
communications services, principally local, network access and long distance
services in Ohio.  The principal industries in its service area include a
variety of both large and small industrial, commercial and agricultural
businesses.

Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
United Telephone Company of Ohio, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, United
Telephone Long Distance, Inc. (UTLD) and United Telephone Communications 
Services of Ohio, Inc., collectively referred to as the "Company".  All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The Company is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint Corporation (Sprint); accordingly, earnings
per share information has been omitted.

     The Company accounts for the economic effects of regulation pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation", which requires the accounting
recognition of the rate actions of regulators where appropriate.  Such actions
can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset, reduce or
eliminate the value of an asset, or impose a liability on a regulated 
enterprise.

     Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
1992 and 1991 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of amounts 
in the 1993 consolidated financial statements.  These reclassifications had no
effect on net income in either year.

Cash and Equivalents

     Cash equivalents generally include highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates
market value.

Inventories

     Inventories consist of materials and supplies, stated at average cost, and
equipment held for resale, stated at the lower of average cost or market.  The
sales inventory balances were $377,000 and $291,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

     Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Retirements of
depreciable property are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain
or loss recognized.  Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  December 31, 1993


1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


Depreciation

     Depreciation expense is generally computed on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives as prescribed by regulatory commissions.  As ordered by
the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Company recorded an
amortization of a reserve deficiency to depreciation expense in the amount of
$5,447,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, which reduced net income by $3,149,000,
$3,122,000 and $3,145,000, respectively.  Average annual composite depreciation
rates, excluding the nonrecurring charges, were 7.5 percent for 1993, 7.3
percent for 1992 and 7.5 percent for 1991.

Income Taxes

     Operations of the Company are included in the consolidated federal income
tax returns of Sprint.  Federal income tax is calculated by the Company on the
basis of its filing a separate return.

     Effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes by adopting SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which
requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 109, the Company adjusted existing deferred income
tax amounts, using current tax rates, for the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of the Company's
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
The Company's principal temporary difference results from using different
depreciable lives and methods with respect to its property, plant and equipment
for tax and financial reporting purposes.

     As a result of corporate income tax rate reductions in prior years and the
previous income tax accounting standards which did not permit accumulated
deferred income tax amounts to be adjusted for subsequent tax rate changes,
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a decrease in the amount of deferred
income tax liabilities recorded.  However, because this decrease will accrue to
the benefit of the Company's customers through future telephone rates
established by the Company's regulators, this decrease in deferred income tax
liabilities has been reflected as a regulatory liability in the Company's
financial statements.  Additionally, deferred income taxes were not provided
in prior years in those instances where the Company's regulators did not
recognize such deferred income taxes for ratemaking purposes.  Upon adoption of
SFAS No. 109, the Company recognized deferred income tax liabilities for those
temporary differences for which deferred income taxes had not previously been
provided.  Corresponding regulatory assets were also recorded by the Company to
reflect the anticipated recovery of such taxes in future telephone rates based
on actions of the Company's regulators.

     Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no significant effect upon
the Company's 1992 net income.  As allowed by SFAS No. 109, prior years'
consolidated financial statements were not restated.

     During 1991, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB)
No. 11, deferred income taxes were provided for all differences in timing of
reporting income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes,
except for items that were not allowable by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) or the PUCO, as an expense for rate-making purposes.

1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Income Taxes (continued)

     Investment tax credits (ITC) are deferred and amortized over the useful
life of the related property.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 effectively eliminated
ITC after December 31, 1985.

Postretirement Benefits

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits (principally health care benefits) provided to certain
retirees by adopting SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions."  SFAS No. 106 requires accrual of the expected
cost of providing postretirement benefits to employees and their dependents or
beneficiaries during the years employees earn the benefits.  As permitted by
SFAS No. 106, the Company elected to recognize the obligation for postretirement
benefits already earned by its current retirees and active work force as of
January 1, 1993, by amortizing such obligation on a straight-line basis over a
period of twenty years.

     During 1992 and 1991, the Company expensed postretirement benefits as such
costs were paid.

Postemployment Benefits

     Effective January 1, 1994, the Company will adopt SFAS No 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  Under the new standard, the Company is
required to recognize certain previously unrecorded obligations for benefits
provided to former or inactive employees and their dependents, after employment
but before retirement.  Postemployment benefits offered by the Company include
severance, workers' compensation and disability benefits, including the
continuation of other benefits such as health care and life insurance coverage.
As required by the standard, the Company will recognize its obligations for
postemployment benefits through a cumulative adjustment in the consolidated
income statement.  The resulting nonrecurring, non-cash charge will not
significantly impact the Company's 1994 net income.  Adoption of this standard
is not expected to significantly impact future operating expenses.

Interest Charged to Construction

     In accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts, as prescribed by the 
FCC, interest is capitalized on those telephone plant construction projects for
which the estimated construction period exceeds one year.  In addition, the PUCO
has ordered that the Company also capitalize interest during construction on
short-term projects.

2.   MERGER AND INTEGRATION COSTS

     Effective March 9, 1993, Sprint consummated its merger with Centel
Corporation (Centel), a telecommunications company with local exchange and
cellular/wireless communications services operations.  Centel's local exchange
telephone businesses operate in six states:  Florida, North Carolina, Virginia,
Illinois, Texas and Nevada.  Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
May 27, 1992, Sprint issued 1.37 shares of its common stock in exchange for each
outstanding share of Centel common stock.

2.   MERGER AND INTEGRATION COSTS (continued)
      
     The operations of the merged companies are being integrated and
restructured to achieve efficiencies which are expected to yield significant
operational synergies and cost savings.  The transaction costs associated with
the merger and the estimated expenses of integrating and restructuring the
operations of the two companies resulted in nonrecurring charges to Sprint
during 1993.  The portion of such charges attributable to the Company was
$12,816,000, which reduced 1993 net income by approximately $8,300,000.

3.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plan

     Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan.  For participants of the plan represented by
collective bargaining units, benefits are based upon schedules of defined
amounts as negotiated by the respective parties.  For participants not covered
by collective bargaining agreements, the plan provides pension benefits based
upon years of service and participants' compensation.

     The Company's policy is to make contributions to the plan each year equal
to an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal tax
regulations.  The funding objective is to accumulate funds at a relatively
stable rate over the participants' working lives so that benefits are fully
funded at retirement.  As of December 31, 1993, the plan's assets consisted
principally of investments in corporate equity securities and U.S. government
and corporate debt securities.

     The components of the net pension credits and related assumptions are as
follows (in thousands):

                                                    1993       1992      1991

     The projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, were
determined using a discount rate of 7.50% for 1993 and of 8.00% for 1992, and
anticipated composite rates of future increases in compensation of 4.50% for
1993 and of 5.50% for 1992.

Defined Contribution Plans

     Sprint sponsors two defined contribution employee savings plans covering
substantially all employees of the Company.  Participants may contribute
portions of their compensation to the plans.  Contributions of participants
represented by collective bargaining units are matched by the Company based upon
defined amounts as negotiated by the respective parties.  Contributions of
participants not covered by collective bargaining agreements are also matched by
the Company.  For these participants, the Company provides matching
contributions equal to 50 percent of participants' contributions up to 6 percent
of their base compensation and may, at the discretion of Sprint's Board of
Directors, provide additional matching contributions based upon the performance
of Sprint's common stock price in comparison to other telecommunications
companies.  The Company's contributions to the plans aggregated $2,280,000,
$1,612,000 and $1,651,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits

     The Company provides other postretirement benefits (principally health care
benefits) to certain retirees.  Substantially all employees who retired from the
Company before January 1, 1991, became eligible for these postretirement
benefits at no cost to the retirees.  Employees retiring after such date, who
meet specified age and years of service requirements, are eligible for these
benefits on a shared cost basis, with the Company's portion of the cost
determined by the retirees' years of credited service at retirement.  The
Company funds the accrued costs as benefits are paid.

3.   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLAN (continued)


Postretirement Benefits (continued)

     For regulatory purposes, the FCC permits recognition of net postretirement
benefits costs, including amortization of the transition obligation, in
accordance with SFAS No. 106.

     The components of the 1993 net postretirement benefits cost are as follows
(in thousands):

     Service cost -- benefits earned during the period                   $ 1,857
     Interest on accumulated postretirement benefits obligation            5,325
     Amortization of transition obligation                                 3,395
                                                                         -------
     Net postretirement benefits cost                                    $10,577

     For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost trend rate of 13
percent was assumed for 1993, gradually decreasing to 6 percent by 2001 and
remaining constant thereafter.  The effect of a one percent annual increase in
the assumed trend rate would have increased the 1993 net postretirement benefits
cost by approximately $1,721,000.  The weighted average discount rate for 1993
was 8 percent.

     The cost of providing health care benefits to retirees was $2,016,000 and
$1,698,000 in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     The amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
1993, is as follows (in thousands):

     Accrued postretirement benefits cost                              $ 8,596

     The accumulated benefits obligation as of December 31, 1993, was determined
using a discount rate of 7.5 percent.  An annual health care cost trend rate of
12 percent was assumed for 1994, gradually decreasing to 6 percent by 2001 and
remaining constant thereafter.  The effect of a one percent annual increase in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the accumulated
benefits obligations as of December 31, 1993, by approximately $10,239,000.

4.  INCOME TAXES (continued)

      During 1993 and 1992, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, deferred income
taxes were provided for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of the Company's assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and
their tax bases.  The sources of the differences that give rise to the deferred

      On August 10, 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act) was
enacted which, among other changes, raised the federal income tax rate for
corporations to 35 percent from 34 percent, retroactive to the beginning of the
year.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 71, the resulting adjustments to the Company's
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the revised rate have
generally been reflected as reductions to the related regulatory liabilities.

      During 1991, in accordance with APB No. 11, deferred income tax provisions
resulted from the differences in the timing of recognizing certain revenues and
expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.  The sources of the
differences, along with the income tax effect of each, were as follows (in

     Advances from parent company were classified as long-term debt at December
31, 1992, as they were replaced with $40,000,000 of 7.11% series CC seven-year
First Mortgage Bonds issued in February 1993.

     Long-term debt maturities during the next five years consist of $1,587,000
scheduled for repayment in 1994.

     The first mortgage bonds are secured by substantially all of the Company's
property, plant, and equipment.

     Under the most restricted terms of the Company's first mortgage bond
indentures, $56,629,000 of retained earnings were restricted from payment of
dividends at December 31, 1993.

     As of December 31, 1993, the Company had lines of credit with banks
totalling $20,000,000, all of which was available at year end.   The bank lines,
which renew annually on various dates, provide for short-term borrowings at
market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees based on the unused
portion.  Lines of credit may be withdrawn by the banks if there is a material
adverse change in the financial condition of the Company.

     During 1993, the Company redeemed prior to scheduled maturities $75,950,000
of first mortgage bonds with interest rates from 6.875 percent to 9.0 percent.
During 1992, the Company redeemed, prior to scheduled maturities, $43,850,000 of
first mortgage bonds with interest rates ranging from 8.875 percent to 10.25
percent.  The payment penalties related to these early extinguishments of debt  
were not significant.
