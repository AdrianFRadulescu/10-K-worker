                                  PART I

Item 1.   Business:

(a)       Weis Markets, Inc. is a Pennsylvania business corporation formed
          in 1924.  The Company is engaged principally in the retail sale of
          food.  There was no material change in the nature of the company's
          business during fiscal 1993.

(b)       The principal business activity which the company has been engaged
          in for the last five fiscal years is the retail sale of food.

(c)(1)(i) The company operates 117 retail food markets in Pennsylvania,
          15 in Maryland, 1 in New Jersey, 3 in New York, 4 in Virginia, and
          1 in West Virginia.  The stores trade under the name Weis Markets,
          except for 18 Pennsylvania stores which trade as Mr. Z's Food Mart,
          2 Pennsylvania stores which trade as Erb's, 4 Pennsylvania stores
          which trade as Scot's Lo Cost, and 1 Pennsylvania store which trades
          as Big Top Market.  During the past fiscal year, 4 new stores were
          opened and 3 were closed.  The company also owns and operates
          Weis Food Service, a restaurant and institutional supplier.  The
          company supplies its stores from distribution centers in Sunbury,
          Northumberland, and Milton, Pennsylvania.  The percentage of net sales
          contributed by each class of similar products for each of the five
          fiscal years ended December 25, 1993 was:

                       Grocery      Meat   Produce     Other

          1989           62.89     15.03     11.69     10.39

(c)(1)(vi)The Company has its own distribution center with warehouses located
          within a 15 mile radius of its corporate offices in Sunbury,
          Pennsylvania.  The Company is required to use a significant amount
          of working capital to provide for the required amount of inventory
          to meet demand for its products with efficient use of buying power
          and space in the warehouse facilities.

(c)(1)(x)The business of the company is highly competitive, and, in the areas
         served by it, the company competes based on price and service with
         national retail food chains, local chains and many independent food
         stores.  The following list includes, but is not limited to, the
         competitors of the Company: Acme Markets, Inc., Giant Foods of

         Super Rite, Giant Eagle, Riverside Markets, Super Valu, Aldi,
         Insalaco, Walmart, K-Mart, Sam's and A&P.  On the basis of sales
         volume, the company believes it is the leading food retailer in the
         majority of the areas in which it operates.

(c)(1)(xiii)The company has approximately 15,000 employees.

          The company owns and operates 68 of its stores and leases and operates

          equipment in its stores and several parcels of vacant land which are
          available as locations for possible future stores or other expansion.

          The company  owns and operates two warehouses in Sunbury, Pennsylvania
          totaling approximately 551,000 square feet: one in Milton,
          Pennsylvania of approximately 1,016,000 square feet, and two in
          Northumberland, Pennsylvania totaling approximately 121,000 square

To Our Shareholders
     We are pleased to report that sales for Weis Markets for the 52-week fiscal
year ended December 25, 1993, increased 11.8% to $1,441,090,000 compared with
$1,289,195,000 for the same period a year ago.  Earnings were $72,953,000
compared to $72,716,000 last year, an increase of .3%.

     Earnings per share were $1.66 compared with $1.65 per share last year. 
Depreciation and amortization increased to $28,959,000 from $26,358,000 in 1992
and return on equity was 10.3%.  Shareholders' equity rose to $738,115,000 from
$680,265,000 in 1992.

    Sales increases came primarily from new and enlarged stores and Mr. Z's Food
Mart stores in Northeastern Pennsylvania, which were acquired at the beginning
of the year.  Increased competition, weakness in the economy, lower retail
prices, low inflation, and increased promotional expense continued to
characterize the year 1993 in our trading area.  This environment was conducive
to increasing the sales of private label merchandise, one of the company's
strongest assets.

     In 1993, we added 562,839 square feet of retail space.  Four new super
stores were opened in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, averaging about 45,000
square feet with pharmacies, floral departments, bakeries, delis, and salad
bars.  One of these stores was opened under the Scot's Lo-Cost format, a
warehouse-type market. Full-service banks were installed in a number of stores.
Thirteen stores were enlarged or remodeled.  Retail space now totals 5,142,000
square feet.  More than half of all stores are new or have been remodeled in
the last five years.  At the end of the year, construction was substantially
completed on the 184,000 square-foot addition to the Milton Distribution
Center.  It will house Shamrock Wholesale Distributing Company, a
wholly owned organization developed to buy, sell, and distribute nonfoods,
health and beauty care, and other products.  The addition will also provide new
space for distribution of private label bread, snacks, and other grocery items.

     At the end of the year, Weis Markets had 141 stores in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York,  Virginia, and West Virginia, and Weis Food
Service -    a restaurant and institutional supplier.  Three stores were closed
during the year.

<PAGE>
     After the end of the year, the company made an investment in several large
pet supply stores in Ohio called SuperPetz.  It is anticipated that the number
of these stores will grow into a successful chain in many areas of the country.

    The Company continues to develop improved programs to meet the needs of its
customers.  We installed a targeted coupon dispensing system at more than two
thirds of all checkouts before the end of 1993.  The point-of-sale computer-
based system dispenses coupons based on customers' purchases and will be
installed company wide before the end of this first quarter of 1994.  The
Company's front-end systems will be enhanced in many stores to allow use of
three major credit cards.At our general office, improvements will continue
with the installation of a new central computer system.  This system is based
on newly developed technology which will provide almost triple the processing
speed while requiring significantly less maintenance and energy consumption.
The upgraded equipment is to be installed in the first quarter of 1994, just in
advance of planned improvements in store communication and merchandising
information systems.

     Capital expenditures including acquisitions for 1993 totaled about
$64,412,000, compared to the budgeted figures of $55,527,000.  We expect to
spend about $76,000,000 over the next eighteen months, provided that our
program of new and remodeled stores can be completed. Long approval times
still make predicting project completion a tentative factor.

     Two new stores are now under construction.  Eight more are in the planning
or approval stage and should be completed in the next eighteen months. Over
this period of time, about twenty stores should be remodeled or enlarged.
Construction is underway on several of these projects.  New stores are planned
for Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey.  Financing for the new and remodeled
stores will come from company funds, and the company will continue to have no
debt.

     Mr. Charles H. Watts II, director for eighteen years, will not be standing
for reelection this year.  We wish to extend our appreciation for his guidance
and counsel as a member of the board during a period of greatcompany growth.

     With our new and acquired stores, plus our capable and energetic Weis
Markets people, our company should have a successful year, growth and profits
in 1994.

Service and Value
Old-Fashioned Quality and Innovative Programs Lead the Way

     During these uncertain economic times, the last thing anyone should have
to worry about is a grocery bill.  At Weis Markets, we understand that -  after
all, we buy groceries, too.  That's why we're ahead of the rest in finding new
ways to give our loyal customers the service and value they deserve at a price
they can afford.

Checkout Coupons:  Personalized for the Way You Shop
No two shoppers are exactly alike.  Their tastes, needs, and shopping habits
vary as much as their clothing style or the cars they drive. Yet every year,
in newspapers, magazines, and even the U.S. mail, they receive thousands of
coupons that they will never use.

     At Weis Markets, we know the value of coupon shopping  when the coupons
match the products our customers actually buy. That's the theory behind Checkout
Coupons, our individualized coupon program.  Shoppers simply buy their groceries
as usual.  As their items are rung up, our computerized registers print out
Checkout Coupons right along with their receipt.  No hold-ups at the checkout
line, no coupons for products our shoppers don't need or want.  Just super
coupon values designed to meet personal shopping needs.  With Weis Markets
Checkout Coupons it's easy to stretch a weekly food budget.

     More than two thirds of our supermarkets offered Checkout Coupons at the
close of 1993, and during the first quarter of 1994 this program will be
expanded to all stores with checkout scanners.

Weis Vision Value Club:  Frequent Shopper Points Add Up
Many Weis shoppers visit our stores weekly.  And with our new Vision Value Club,
currently being tested in a limited area, frequent shoppers can earn points
for free gifts at no extra charge. . .and no extra effort!

     Membership in the Vision Value Club isn't exclusive - it's a breeze.  After
signing up, frequent shoppers simply make their purchases as usual.  As items
are totaled, points are accumulated and stored electronically on a special
computer chip membership card right at the checkout.  Shoppers may redeem those
points for brand name merchandise through the Vision Value Club gift catalog.
And as a bonus, specials like coupons, recipes, sweepstakes, games and more
appear automatically on the Vision Screen during checkout, adding further value
to frequent shopping.

<PAGE>
New Store Locations and Acquisitions:  Convenience and Competition Wins
Hands Down
With today's shoppers' busy schedules, even the most innovative and profitable
savings programs can't match the value of convenient shopping locations.  That's
why we at Weis Markets are always looking for ways to expand our service area. 
In 1993, we acquired fourteen Mr. Z's Markets, bringing the total number of our
convenient shopping locations to 141.  Mr. Z's Markets are concentrated in the
Northeastern Pennsylvania area.  Of course, customers will see the same low
prices and excellent service they've come to expect at all Weis Markets
locations.

     In addition to acquisitions, we've opened new Weis Markets in
Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania and in Newton, New Jersey, the first Weis Markets in
New Jersey.  A Scot's Lo-Cost Supermarket was opened in Montoursville,
Pennsylvania and a new Mr. Z' s in Waverly, Pennsylvania.  Our growing customer
base is proof that it's quality products and dollar value that count. . .week
after week.

Business As Usual:  Those Little "Extras"  Make Shopping a Pleasure
No matter which store they visit, our customers know that service and value are
just "company policy" at Weis Markets.  More than 15,000 employees are hard
at work to make shopping a little more pleasant at every convenient location.
For example, our informative deli people can help busy shoppers find the perfect
prepared food to take home to a hungry family, without sacrificing nutritional
value.  And with new products being added all the time, they don't have to
forego variety either.  In the pharmacy, our professional staff is waiting to
answer questions regarding medicines and health concerns.  Third Party 
Departments and Weis' own computerized patient profile system make getting
prescriptions that much easier.  Of course, our butchers are always happy to
provide special meat cuts, while our bakery specialists add just the right
touches to festive party delicacies.  And checking out isn't a hassle, either.
Courteous register clerks and baggers end the shopping trip on an upbeat note.

     At Weis Markets, we know that special deals and exciting programs
 -    though valuable -    aren't enough.  Getting more for their money on
everyday buys is what brings our shoppers back week after week.  From well-
stocked fresh produce aisles, to a wide variety of succulent meats, to
thousands of brand names, our customers find competitive prices on everything
they need.  More than 1,800 of our own private label products -    including
"Weis Quality," "Big Top" and "The Way It Was" -    line our shelves, ensuring
that shoppers don't have to sacrifice top quality for extra value.  And Weis
Markets' SUPER BUYS add yet another way to save;  economical larger sizes,
bonus packs and special features mean greater savings on weekly shopping
budgets.

In the supermarket business, the competition can be keen.  And at Weis Markets,
we know that creative solutions to meeting our shoppers' needs are crucial to
our continued success.  But we haven't forgotten that good old-fashioned
excellent service and unbeatable quality are what guarantees customer
satisfaction. You might just say that's what puts Weis Markets Ahead of the
Rest.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations
    Sales for the 52 - week period ended December 25, 1993 of $1,441,090,000
increased 11.8% over sales of $1,289,195,000 for the 1992 fiscal year.  Sales
in 1992 had decreased .4% compared with fiscal 1991 sales of $1,294,332,000.
The majority of the sales increase in the current year was generated from the
14 IGA stores acquired.  Same store sales decreased 1.2 % in 1993.  During the
last three years, the Company has experienced increased competitive activity
in a weak economy with very little price inflation in each of the three years.
Management anticipates a slight increase in inflation in 1994 but no decline
in competitive activity.

   	Expressed as a percentage of sales, the gross profit at 25.5% in 1993,
compares with 25.4% in 1992 and 25.7% in 1991.  The Company has maintained
its gross margin at a consistent rate over the past three years through its
use of category management and the fact that suppliers have shifted traditional
promotional funding towards the cost of product.  The LIFO inventory adjustment
in 1993 resulted in a charge to earnings of $510,000 compared to $2,321,000 in
1992.

    Operating, general and administrative expenses of 20.0% as a percentage of
fiscal 1993 sales compares with 19.5% in 1992 and 18.9% in 1991.  The majority
of the total dollar increase in 1993 expenses was directly associated with the
operation of the new stores acquired at the beginning of the year.  Labor and
associated fringe benefit costs, as a percentage of sales, increased .28% from
1992 to 1993.  Advertising expenditures, net of promotional funding, increased
.34% from 1992 to 1993.

    Interest and dividend income of $21,528,000, at 1.5% of sales in 1993
compared to $23,783,000, at 1.8% of sales  in 1992, and $25,935,000, at 2.0%
of sales in 1991.  Investment income has continued to decline as a result of
the decline in market rates over the past three years.  The investment portfolio
consists of Pennsylvania tax free municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury securities,
equity securities and other short-term investments.  The Company has made
an effort to offset the decline in short term yields by extending its investment
maturities.  It is management's intent to maintain a liquid portfolio to take
advantage of acquisition or other investment opportunities; therefore all
securities are classified as available-for-sale.

    Other income is primarily generated from rental income, coupon handling
fees, cardboard salvage and gains on sales of fixed assets.  Other income
increased $1,421,000 in 1993 compared to 1992 as a result of the acquired
stores.  Expressed as a percentage of sales, other income at .9% in 1993,
compared to .9% in 1992, and .8% in 1991.

    The effective tax rate was 35.8% in 1993, 35.0% in 1992, and 35.1% in 1991.
Corporate federal tax rates increased from 34% to 35% during the current year,
having a negative impact of $928,000 to the current year profits.  The Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," as of December 29, 1991, which resulted in a cumulative
effect adjustment of $1,046,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1992.

During fiscal 1993, the Company opened four new stores, closed three existing
stores, remodeled 13 stores, and completed the acquisition of 14 IGA stores
located in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  The distribution center was enlarged by
184,000 square feet to meet the current and future service demands associated
with the store growth.  As of its fiscal year end Weis Markets, Inc. was
operating 141 retail food stores and Weis Food Service, a restaurant and
institutional supplier.  The company currently operates stores in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
    The Company has consistently funded its working capital requirements each
year through internally generated cash flows from operations.  Net cash
provided by operating activities was $104,103,000 in 1993, compared to
$83,282,000 in 1992 and $98,796,000 in 1991.  Working capital has increased by
6.1% in 1993, 5.9% in 1992 and 5.7% in 1991.  The increase in working capital
in 1993 was impacted by the adoption of the provisions of the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" (Statement 115).  Had Statement 115 not been
adopted, working capital would have increased by 2.7% in 1993.

    The Company continues to use its cash for acquisitions, the construction of
new supermarkets, the expansion and remodeling of existing stores, the securing
of sites for future expansion, and the upgrading of the processing and
distribution facilities.  Property, equipment and other acquisition expenditures
during fiscal 1993 amounted to $64,412,000 compared to $31,985,000 in 1992
and $40,526,000 in 1991.  Treasury Stock purchases amounted to $1,149,000 in
1993, compared to $10,044,000 in 1992, and $14,914,000 in 1991.  The Board of
Directors' 1991 resolution authorizing the purchase of treasury stock has a
remaining balance of 696,000 shares.  Total cash dividend payments on common
stock amounted to $.70 per share in 1993, compared to $.68 in 1992 and $.64
in 1991.

    The Company's current store development plans will require investment of
approximately $76,000,000 during the next eighteen months.  This includes the
opening of ten new stores, completion of 20 store remodels, and significant
improvements in the area of store and general office technology.  The Company
is actively seeking acquisitions and investment opportunities so as to enhance
future performance.  In view of the Company's significant liquid assets, no
existing debt financing, and its ability to generate working capital internally,
it is not expected that any type of external financing will be needed.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in
preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements:

(a)  Definition of Fiscal Year
The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December.  Fiscal 1993,
1992, and 1991 were each comprised of 52 weeks.

(b)  Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the  accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.

(c)  Business Segment
The principal business activity reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements is the retail sale of food.

(d)  Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 40
years.  A portion of the excess of cost of investments over net assets
acquired prior to November 1, 1970, ($2,322,000) is not being amortized
because, in the opinion of management, there has been no decrease in value.

(e)  Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, using both the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) and average cost methods.

(f)  Marketable securities
Marketable securities at December 25, 1993, consist of Pennsylvania municipal
bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, equity securities, and other short-term
investments.  The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" (Statement 115) at December 25, 1993.  Under Statement
115, the Company classifies all of its marketable securities as available-for-
sale.
    Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from
earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until
realized.  A decline in the market value below cost that is deemed other than
temporary results in a charge to earnings and the establishment of a new cost
basis for the security.  Dividend and interest income are recognized when
earned.  Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived
using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities.
    Prior to adopting Statement 115, the Company valued its'securities in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 12,
"Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities" (Statement 12) and related
interpretations.  Marketable debt securities were carried at amortized cost
and marketable equity securities were carried at the lower of cost or market.

(g)  Property and Equipment
Depreciation is provided on the cost of buildings and improvements and
equipment principally using accelerated methods. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the terms of the lease or the useful lives of the assets,
whichever is shorter.
    Maintenance and repairs are charged to income and renewals and betterments
are capitalized.  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any
profit or loss on the disposition is credited or charged to income.

(h)  Income Taxes
In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
(Statement 109).  Statement 109 requires a change from the deferred method of
accounting for income taxes of APB Opinion 11 to the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the asset and liability method
of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
    Effective December 29, 1991, the Company adopted Statement 109 and has
reported the cumulative effect of that change in the method of accounting
for income taxes in the 1992 consolidated statement of income.
    Pursuant to the deferred method under APB Opinion 11, which was applied in
1991 and prior years, deferred income taxes are recognized for income and
expense items that are reported in different years for financial reporting
purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate applicable for the year of
the calculation.  Under the deferred method, deferred taxes are not adjusted
for subsequent changes in tax rates.
 
<PAGE>
(i)  Earnings Per Share
The earnings per share computations are based upon the weighted average number
of common shares and common share equivilants outstanding during the year.

(j)  Reclassification
Certain amounts in prior-year financial statements have been reclassified to
conform with current year classifications.

(2)  Income Taxes
As discussed in note 1, the Company adopted Statement 109 as of December 29,
1991.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of
$1,046,000 is determined as of December 29, 1991, and is reported separately
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 26, 1992.
Prior years' financial statements have not been restated to apply the
provisions of Statement 109.

The following is a reconciliation between the applicable income tax expense
and the amount of income taxes which would have been provided at the Federal
statutory rate.  The statutory rate was 35% in 1993, 34% in 1992, and 34% in
1991.  The tax rate change in 1993 had a negative impact of $928,000 to the
current year profits.

    Although management believes the use of the LIFO method for valuing
certain inventories (as set forth above) represents the most appropriate
matching of costs and revenues in the Company's circumstances, the following
summary of net income and per share amounts based on the use of the average
cost method for valuing all inventories is presented for comparative purposes.

</TABLE>

For the year ended December 26, 1992, marketable debt securities and marketable
equity securities were valued in accordance with Statement 12.  Marketable
debt securities consisted primarily of Pennsylvania municipal bonds and U. S.
Treasury securities and had a cost of $408,978,000 at December 26, 1992, and a
market value of $419,701,000.  Gross unrealized gains amounted to $10,723,000.
    Also included in marketable securities were marketable equity securities
having a cost of $10,337,000 at December 26, 1992, and a market value of
$21,780,000.  Gross unrealized gains amounted to $11,443,000.
     Unrealized gross losses and realized gains and losses of the marketable
securities portfolios were not significant.

(6)  Retirement Plans
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all full-time employees, a noncontributory profit-sharing plan
covering eligible employees and a supplemental retirement plan covering certain
officers of the company.  An eligible employee as defined in the Profit Sharing
Plan includes salaried employees, store management and administrative support
personnel.  The Company's policy is to fund pension and profit-sharing cost
accrued, but not supplemental retirement costs.  Contri-butions to the defined
benefit pension plan are based on guidelines of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, whereas contributions to the profit-sharing plan are made
at the sole discretion of the Company.  The Company's supplemental retirement
plan provides for the payment of specific amounts of annual retirement benefits
to the officers or to their beneficiaries over an actuarially computed normal
life expectancy.  The actuarial present value of accumulated benefits amounted
to $5,408,000 and $4,782,000 at December 25, 1993, and December 26, 1992,
respectively.  Plan costs are based upon the deferral of retirement rather than
upon future service and all benefits are fully vested.  Retirement plan costs
amounted to:

    Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks, bonds, and U.S. government
obligations.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9%.
Pension benefit obligations were determined using an assumed discount rate of
6.75% and 7%, respectively, and an assumed long-term rate of compensation
increase of 5%.
    In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87, OAccounting for Pensions," the Company has recorded an
additional minimum liability of $2,770,000 at December 25, 1993, representing
the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan
assets and accrued pension cost.  The additional liability has been offset
by an intangible asset to the extent of previously unrecognized prior service
cost.  The amount in excess of previously unrecognized prior service cost is
recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity in the amount of $125,000,
representing the after-tax impact.
    The Company has no other post-retirement benefit plans.

(7)  Incentive Plans
(a)  Stock Option Plan
The Company has an incentive stock option plan for officers and other key

(b)  Company Appreciation Plan
Under a Company Appreciation Plan, officers and other employees are awarded
rights equivalent to shares of Company common stock.  At the maturity date,
usually one year after the date of award, the value of any appreciation
from the original date of issue is paid in cash to the participants.
    During 1993, 1992 and 1991, 17,500, 16,900 and 17,800 rights were awarded
under the program.  In 1993, 1992 and 1991, $37,000, $11,000 and $35,000, 
respectively, were charged to earnings.

(8)  Lease Commitments
At December 25, 1993, the Company leased approximately 55% of its facilities
under operating leases which expire at various dates up to 2013.  These leases
generally provide for fixed annual rentals; however, several provide for
minimum annual rentals plus contingent rentals as a percentage of annual
sales and a number of leases require the Company to pay for all or a portion
Of insurance, real estate taxes, water and sewer rentals and repairs, the
cost of which is charged to the related expense category rather than being
accounted for as rent expense.  Most of the leases contain multiple renewal
options, under which the Company may extend the lease terms from 5 to 20
years.

Rent expense on all leases consists of:

(9)  Fair Value Information
The carrying amounts for cash, trade receivables and trade payables approximate
fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments.  The fair
values of the Company's marketable securities are based on quoted market prices.

Independent Auditors' Report

KPMG Peat MarwickCertified Public Accountants
225 Market Street
Harrisburg, PA 17108-1190

To the Shareholders of  Weis Markets, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weis Markets,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 25, 1993 and December 26, 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 1993.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Weis
Markets, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 25, 1993 and December 26, 1992 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 25, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for investments at December 25,
1993 to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  As discussed in notes 1 and 2 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income taxes in 1992 to adopt the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
