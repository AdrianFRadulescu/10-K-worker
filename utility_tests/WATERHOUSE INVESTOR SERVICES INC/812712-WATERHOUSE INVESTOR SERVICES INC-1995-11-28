                                      ------

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

(a) General Development of Business
    -------------------------------

     Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. ("Waterhouse" or the "Company"), 
is a holding company engaged through its principal subsidiary, Waterhouse 
Securities, Inc. in providing discount brokerage and related financial 
services primarily to retail customers throughout the United States.

     Waterhouse Securities, Inc., ("Waterhouse Securities") commenced 
operations in March 1979 with four employees in a single office located in 
New York City.  Waterhouse Securities has grown steadily and employs 
approximately 1,000 employees, including 551 Account Officers in 72 branch 
offices located in 37 states and the District of Columbia.  Waterhouse 
Securities currently has over 450,000 customer accounts, of which 
approximately 300,000 are active accounts, located throughout the United 
States.

     Waterhouse Securities is registered as a broker-dealer with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), is a member of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"), the Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the 
"NYSE"), is an associate member of the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX"), a 
member of the Pacific and Chicago Stock Exchanges and is registered as a 
broker-dealer under the laws of all fifty states of the United States, the 
District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

     With the establishment of Waterhouse National Bank (the "Bank") as a 
wholly owned subsidiary, the Company, as of October 13, 1994, has been 
registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 
1956, as amended (the "BHC Act").  The Bank was established to provide the 
Company with the ability to offer expanded financial services and products 
primarily to the customer base of Waterhouse Securities.

(b) Financial Information about Industry Segments
    ---------------------------------------------
  
     The Company operates in a single industry segment, except for the 
operations of certain of its subsidiaries which are not material, and has no 
foreign operations.  No material part of the Company's consolidated revenue is 
received from a single customer or group of customers.

(c) Narrative Description of Business 
    ---------------------------------
 
     The Company, through its principal subsidiary, Waterhouse Securities, is 
among the lowest cost providers of nationwide discount brokerage and related 
financial services directed primarily to individual investors.  Waterhouse 
Securities has experienced rapid growth in customer accounts and trade 
processing activity, and management believes it is currently the nation's 5th 
leading provider of discount brokerage services in the United States, with 72 
branch offices in 37 states and the District of Columbia.

<PAGE> 3

     Since the abolishment of fixed commissions in 1975, the discount brokerage 
business has evolved from what was regarded as a mere commission-saving service 
to an important industry serving a growing number of investors who make their 
own investment decisions and do not wish to pay for the assistance, advice 
and research of a full-service brokerage firm.  According to information 
compiled by the Securities Industry Association, the demand for discount 
brokerage services has increased substantially over the past 11 years, with 
discount brokerage firms accounting for 14.5% of total retail commission 
revenues generated in 1994 up from 4.6% in 1983.

     Waterhouse Securities offers its customers a wide array of products and 
services, including prompt and accurate execution of unsolicited orders to 
purchase and sell securities, rapid access to pricing, volume and other market 
information, related financial services provided by the Bank, free 
investment information and professional and courteous service provided 
through a personal Account Officer.  By concentrating on the self-directed 
investor, maintaining a low-cost structure and utilizing a highly-automated 
order processing system, Waterhouse Securities can charge commission rates that 
are substantially lower than those charged by full-service brokerage firms as 
well as those of other leading nationwide discount brokers.

Products and Services 

     Discount Brokerage Services - Waterhouse Securities provides its customers 
with a range of discount brokerage and related financial services including the 
execution of customer orders in all listed and over the counter corporate 
securities, all listed equity and index options and municipal and government 
securities.  In addition, Waterhouse Securities offers a daily sweep of cash 
from customer accounts to both an FDIC insured money market fund offered by the 
Bank and an unaffiliated money market mutual fund (not FDIC insured).  
Waterhouse Securities also makes available for purchase or redemption 
approximately 500 no-load and low-load mutual funds for a transaction fee and 
offers over 225 no-load mutual funds for which its customers will not be 
charged a fee.  Dividend reinvestment is available at no cost to all customers
who hold their securities in their Waterhouse accounts. Over 4,000 U.S. 
exchange-listed and NASDAQ stocks are eligible under this program.  
Waterhouse does not offer investment advice, perform any research, provide 
portfolio management, maintain inventories of securities for sale, engage in 
principal or commodity transactions or underwrite securities.

     Through Instanex, a high-speed, automated order processing system which is 
linked to all major exchanges, Waterhouse Securities provides rapid        
execution of customer orders, including execution of market orders in as few as 
six seconds with confirmation generally given to customers while they are still 
on the telephone.  Waterhouse Securities has developed and introduced Trade 
Direct, a touch-tone telephone trading system which enables customers to 
enter orders and obtain real time quotes and account information using a 
touch-tone telephone.  The Company is also in the process of developing an 
on-line, personal computer-based trading system that will enable its 
customers to access account information and effect securities transactions 
with minimal involvement from an Account Officer.

     Waterhouse Securities offers a simple commission schedule, which is a 
single level discount from the commission rates of a representative full-
service brokerage firm, with a minimum 

<PAGE> 4

commission of $35 per transaction.  Waterhouse Securities has not increased its 
commission rate during the past 16 years and intends to maintain its position 
as a low-cost nationwide provider of discount brokerage services.  However, 
Waterhouse Securities may change its commission schedule from time to time in 
the future, as appropriate, in light of inflation, competition, profitability 
and other factors.  Based on current commission schedules, the Company believes
that, generally, the commission rates it charges its customers are 70% lower
than the rates charged by full-service brokerage firms and are, in many 
cases, substantially lower than the rates charged by other nationwide 
discount brokerage firms.

     Waterhouse Securities considers a high level of customer service and 
satisfaction to be among its most important objectives.  Customer satisfaction 
is measured daily through the mailing of hundreds of customer satisfaction 
surveys.  Of those customers responding during calendar year 1995, 99% rated 
the courtesy they received as excellent or good and 98% rated the service they 
received as excellent or good.

     Management believes that an essential component of maintaining customer 
satisfaction is providing effective communication and accountability.  
Waterhouse Securities assigns to each customer a non-commissioned personal 
Account Officer who provides customers with quotes and market information and 
assists in the processing of customer orders.  Account Officers are registered 
with the NYSE and the NASD but do not offer investment advice or solicit 
transactions.

     Waterhouse Securities conducts all aspects of training for its Account 
Officers, branch managers and other personnel.  Training manuals covering 
products and services and telephone techniques have been developed to help the 
firm's Account Officers provide personal, courteous and professional service.  
In addition to its low commission schedule, Waterhouse Securities considers 
customer satisfaction to be a major reason for its success to date.

     The Company believes that its training program and policy of promotion 
from within, coupled with its compensation, stock option, 401K, and employee 
stock ownership plans (the "ESOP") (approximately 12% of the Company is owned 
by the ESOP), have resulted in motivated associates who are substantially 
responsible for the high levels of customer satisfaction.

     Investor Information Services - Waterhouse Securities provides free 
investment information to its active customer base.  This information 
is provided to help the self-directed investor with his or her investment 
decisions.  Included in this package are Standard & Poor's Stock Guides 
(investment data on over 7,000 securities) and Standard & Poor's Stock 
Reports (two-page reports on all NYSE, AMEX and over 1,600 NASDAQ companies).  
These reports are widely used by the individual investor for both current and 
historical financial information.  Available to customers free of charge, on 
request, are a Stock Market Leaders Guide, prepared by Standard & Poor's, which 
ranks stocks according to a variety of investment criteria, a Retirement 
Planning Guide, a 20-page booklet to aid in planning for financial independence 
in retirement, a Tax Planning Guide, a 30-page booklet outlining tax planning 
strategies and tax-saving ideas, and Standard & Poor's The Outlook-the Mid 
Year and Annual Forecast Editions which include investment ideas, strategy 
and specific recommendations for a variety of investment objectives.  

<PAGE> 5

The Individual Investor - a newsletter produced by Waterhouse Securities 
containing interviews with investment advisors and money managers - is included 
with each monthly statement.  In addition, customers, on request, can receive 
a free quarterly Mutual FundConnection  Information & Comparison Guide.  This 
reference guide contains rankings compiled by Micropal, Inc., of over 900 
mutual funds offered through Waterhouse Securities.

     Waterhouse Securities makes available on request, for a fee, Standard & 
Poor's Research Reports on over 3,000 publicly traded companies, these are 
seven-page reports which include analysts' buy/sell/hold recommendations, 
consensus earnings forecast, price and earnings history and other information.  
Also on request, for a fee are Mutual Fund Reports by Morningstar.  These are 
one page reports which contain data and analytical information to help the 
customer determine whether investment in a particular fund would be consistent 
with their investment objective and level of risk.

     Mutual Fund and Advisory Activities - The Company is in the process of 
organizing an investment advisory subsidiary, Waterhouse Asset Management, 
Inc., to be registered under the Investment Advisory Act of 1940.  The 
advisory firm, which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, will 
principally be engaged in providing investment management services to the 
Waterhouse Investors Cash Management Fund, a money market fund in the process 
of organization, and other mutual funds.

     Related Financial Services - Waterhouse Securities offers its customer 
base related financial products and services provided by the Bank.  These 
products and services include an FDIC insured money market sweep account, 
certificates of deposit and access to one's brokerage account by check and an 
ATM/VISA check card.  During fiscal 1996, the Company also intends to introduce 
an Investors Prime Credit Card issued by the Bank.

     Customer Financing Activities - The Company offers both cash and margin 
accounts to its customers.  In an account authorized for margin trading, 
Waterhouse Securities may lend its customers an amount up to that permitted by 
the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB"), currently 50% of the market value of 
securities purchased.  Customer margin loans have grown steadily over the past 
6 years, from $45 million in 1989 to $365 million at the end of fiscal year 
1995.  Interest earned on margin loans, which exceeds the cost of funds incurred
by Waterhouse Securities, has remained a major component of revenues and has 
been a contributing factor to the growth and profitabilty of the Company.  
The amount of the net interest income earned by Waterhouse Securities from 
extending margin loans is affected by customer margin balances and changes in 
prevailing interest rates.

     Margin loans are collateralized by securities held in customer accounts 
and are financed through the use of Waterhouse Securities' capital, convertible 
subordinated notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), free credit balances, 
deposits received for securities loaned and short term borrowings from banks, 
using the margined securities as collateral.  In connection with permitting a 
customer to purchase securities on margin, a clearing firm takes the risk of a 
market decline that may reduce the value of its collateral below the amount 
of the customer's indebtedness which may result in a loss to the firm if 
payment is not received from the customer.  

<PAGE> 6

Under applicable rules and regulations, following the initial purchase of 
securities in a margin account, the Company must require that a customer 
deposit additional securities or cash to ensure that the amount owed by the 
customer is never greater than 75% of the value of the securities in the 
account.  As a matter of policy, the Company generally requires additional 
deposits if the amount owed by the customer exceeds 65% of the value of the 
securities.  To date, Waterhouse Securities has not incurred any substantial  
loss as a result of its margin activities.  To mitigate such risks, management 
has established internal controls and safeguards which it believes are 
adequate.
	
     Through the performance of brokerage and related services, the Company 
earns commissions and clearing fees, interest, mutual fund revenues and other
revenues.  The following table sets forth consolidated revenues of the 
Company and the number of branch offices of Waterhouse Securities in operation 
at year end on a comparative basis for the last three fiscal years.

Branch Office Network	

     From a single office in New York in 1979, Waterhouse Securities has 
grown to a total of 72 offices in 37 states and the District of Columbia.  
Waterhouse Securities intends to open an additional twelve offices in the 
current fiscal year and twelve in fiscal year 1997.  

     Management believes that the existence of branch offices is important in 
opening new customer accounts, and in maintaining a high level of customer 
satisfaction.  Customers generally prefer to conduct business with local 
offices and personnel.  A branch office provides Waterhouse Securities with a 
presence in a particular market area and, in the past, this presence has 
produced an increase in unsolicited customer referrals in that market area, and 
has generally increased Waterhouse Securities' market penetration.  Moreover, 
since Waterhouse Securities primarily conducts nationwide advertising 
campaigns, such market penetration has been achieved without incurring 
significant additional advertising expenses.  No assurance can be given, 
however, that opening additional branch offices will result in increases in 
the customer base of Waterhouse Securities, and marginal or unsuccessful branch 
offices could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.

Advertising and Marketing	

     Advertising and marketing together have also played an important role in 
the growth of new customer accounts and revenues.  Waterhouse Securities' 
advertisements appear on a regular basis in such national publications as The 
Wall Street Journal, Barrons and Investors Business Daily, and run regularly on 
CNBC and other cable television networks and radio.

     The Company places most of its advertising through its in-house 
advertising agency and employs various purchasing strategies to minimize the 
expense of its advertising campaigns.  In addition, the Company uses response
tracking systems, and maintains databases of customer responses to track the 
effectiveness of each advertisement or campaign.  By carefully tracking 
customer responses, the Company can attribute the addition of each new 
customer account to a specific advertisement or medium, and maximize the 
effectiveness of its advertising expenditures.

Competition

     All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive.  Competition 
within the securities industry is principally based on the prices for the 
products and services offered, the quality and type of services offered, the 
amount of capital available to invest in offering new services and reputation 
with customers.  Waterhouse Securities competes directly with many larger,
diversified, well-capitalized national, regional and local full-service and 
discount brokerage firms.

     Waterhouse Securities competes primarily with other nationwide discount 
brokers.  Certain of these competing discount brokers offer services which 
Waterhouse Securities does not presently offer, have a greater number of 
offices and/or have greater financial resources.  Waterhouse Securities 
believes that because of its relatively low cost and variable expense 
structure, its established reputation in the industry, its emphasis on the 
highest quality customer service, and its ability to offer related financial 
services provided by the Bank, it is, and will continue to be, able to 
compete favorably with these competing discount brokers.  As nationwide 
discount brokers expand their branch office networks, it is possible that 
saturation may occur in one or more areas, which may adversely affect the 
customer base and commission revenues of Waterhouse Securities.

     Full-service brokerage firms employ substantial funds in advertising and 
direct solicitation of customers to increase their market share of securities-
related service income, such as 

<PAGE> 8

commissions.  If these firms choose to offer commission rates competitive with 
Waterhouse Securities' commission rates, its customer base and commission 
revenues may be adversely affected.  Management believes, however, that the 
account executive compensation arrangements, direct solicitation costs, 
investment research costs, training costs and other costs which arise out of 
the "full-service" concept associated with these firms, as opposed to the 
"unsolicited execution"  service concept associated with discount brokerage 
firms, make it difficult for full-service brokerage firms to offer substantial 
commission rate discounts to a large portion of their retail customers.

     Laws, rules and regulations affecting the securities and banking industry 
and changes in other laws, rules and regulations, such as tax laws, may change 
the relative competitive positions of various segments of the industry.  As a 
result of these changes and other factors, banks, savings associations, 
insurance companies, and other financial institutions not previously engaged in 
the securities business but having substantial financial resources, have 
acquired or formed securities firms, including discount brokerage firms.  It 
is not possible to predict the impact that these changes and other factors may 
have on the securities industry generally or the Company specifically.  In 
addition, banks, savings associations, insurance companies and other 
financial institutions compete aggressively with the Company for securities-
related service income, such as commission revenue, by offering a wide range 
of financial services and products and by providing commission discounts to 
their retail customers.

Securities Clearing Operation - Correspondent Clearing

     Waterhouse Securities started its self-clearing operation in 1988.  
Clearing activities involve the performance of the confirmation, settlement
and receive and deliver functions involved in all securities transactions.  
Waterhouse Securities' self-clearing operations have generated additional 
revenues, improved customer service, and reduced execution and clearance-
related operating expenses.  Management believes that Waterhouse Securities' 
clearing operation has been a contributing factor to the success and growth 
of the Company.

     Many brokerage firms offer trade execution and clearance services to 
unaffiliated broker-dealers, usually referred to as introducing brokers.  This 
service has evolved over the years as a profitable segment of the securities 
business.  Clearing brokers maintain certain books and records and the capital 
necessary to carry the accounts and margin loans of the introducing brokers.  
They also provide execution, confirmation, and settlement of customer 
transactions for the introducing broker.  The Company believes that its 
self-clearing operation can be adapted to profitably serve unaffiliated 
broker-dealers as well.

     Clearing operations require a substantial capital commitment and are 
dependent upon the proper functioning of sophisticated equipment and the 
services of a number of trained individuals and must be conducted in accordance 
with complex and extensive laws, rules and regulations.  Waterhouse Securities 
assumes the risks associated with making such capital commitment and complying 
with such laws, rules and regulations.  Waterhouse Securities also assumes 
responsibility for errors, omissions and misconduct in connection with 
receiving, holding and delivering funds and securities of, and executing and 
clearing transactions for, its customers.

<PAGE> 9

     Margin loans made by a clearing firm which is a member organization of the 
NYSE are subject to Regulation T of the FRB and the rules of the NYSE.  In 
connection with permitting a customer to purchase securities on margin, a 
clearing firm takes the risk of a market decline that may reduce the value of 
its collateral below the amount of the customer's indebtness which may result
in a loss to the firm if payment is not received from the customer.  
Regulation T provides the purchase of eligible equity securities may not 
exceed 50% of the purchase price.  Under NYSE rules, if the market value of 
the eligible securities in a margin account declines, a clearing firm must 
require the customer to deposit additional eligible securities or cash in the 
margin account so that at all times the amount loaned to the customer is not 
greater than 75% of the market value of the eligible securities held in the 
margin account.  To date, Waterhouse Securities has not incurred any 
substantial loss as a result of its margin activities.  To mitigate such 
risks, management has established internal controls and safeguards which it 
believes are adequate.

     To the extent that an introducing broker serviced by Waterhouse 
Securities has a customer base similar to that of the Company, management 
believes that the risks to itself of performing clearing operations, for 
introducing brokers, will not be substantially different from those described 
above.  Accordingly, the Company intends to solicit brokers whose business is 
substantially similar to that in which Waterhouse Securities is currently 
engaged.  Waterhouse Securities currently services customer accounts of two 
correspondent broker dealers.  The Company believes that its experience in 
dealing with its own customer accounts and these broker-dealers will enable 
it to successfully provide clearing services for introducing brokers.

     On October 27, 1995, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved an 
application by the Company to transfer the execution, clearing and other 
services incidental to brokerage, which are presently performed by Waterhouse
Securities, to a new wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, National Investor
Services Corp. ("NISC").  NISC will be a separately capitalized broker-dealer
registered with the SEC and is applying for membership with the NYSE, the 
NASD, the AMEX, the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange.

Technology

     Waterhouse Securities has used technology to increase operating 
efficiencies and to offer value-added services to its customers.  This 
technology includes an on-line, order management and execution system 
(Instanex) which enables Account Officers to enter and report back the 
execution of most customer orders within seconds, generally while the 
customer remains on the telephone.  In addition, Waterhouse Securities is in 
the process of replacing basic quote terminals with intelligent work stations
throughout its branch network connected over a wide area network.  This will 
allow Account Officers to operate more efficiently and put in place a platform 
from which additional services can be offered to its customers.

     Other important areas in which Waterhouse Securities has developed 
technology-based systems are:  (i) a shareholder accounting and transaction 
processing system which permits no-load mutual funds to be provided to its 
customers; (ii) TradeDirect, which enables customers using a touch-tone 
telephone to enter orders and obtain price quotes and account information; and

<PAGE> 10

(iii) an integrated telephone system which enables the Company to balance 
customer telephone calls between branch offices and call centers and provide 
faster response times.

     Waterhouse Securities and the Bank use third-party service companies for 
most back-office data processing systems.  They believe that such service 
companies' back-office systems are efficient and effective and have enabled 
both organizations to avoid the high capital and manpower costs associated with 
routine back-office processing.  However, the use of third parties for back 
office processing requires reliance on that third party for back-up systems 
in the event of any systems failure.

Employees (Associates)

     The Company has approximately 1,000 employees.  The Company's executive 
management team consists of 13 officers.  All of the Company's employees are 
salaried workers.  The Company does not have any collective bargaining, 
employment or non-competition agreements with any of its employees other than 
with two members of its executive management team.

     The Company's employee relations are good and the Company's compensation 
and employee benefits, which include medical, disability, 401K, ESOP and life 
insurance benefits, are competitive with the compensation and employee benefits 
offered by other discount brokerage firms.

     Fraud and misconduct by employees and the possibility of theft and loss of 
securities are risks inherent in the securities industry.  Management believes, 
however, that the Company's internal controls and safeguards are adequate.  
The Company's principal subsidiaries carry fidelity bonds providing for 
coverage with respect to forgery, theft, loss, embezzlement and similar 
occurrences.  Management believes that present insurance coverage is adequate.

Regulation

     With the establishment of the Bank on October 13, 1994, the Company became 
subject to regulation as a registered bank holding company under the BHC Act.  
As such, the Company is subject to examination by the FRB, regulatory 
reporting requirements, minimum capital requirements and ratios, certain 
restrictions on securities and non-banking activities, transactions with 
affiliates, tie-in arrangements, changes in control, dividend payments, 
redemptions and other payments to security holders, and other restrictions.  
Under FRB policy, the Company, as a bank holding company, will be expected 
to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources 
to support the Bank.

     The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive 
regulation under both federal and state laws.  The SEC is the primary federal 
agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws.  
Waterhouse Securities is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and the 
NASD.  Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to 
self-regulatory organizations, principally the NYSE and the NASD.  The NYSE 
has been designated by the SEC as Waterhouse Securities' designated examinating 
authority.

<PAGE> 11

     In addition to rules adopted by the SEC, the self-regulatory organizations 
adopt rules (subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of 
broker-dealers.  Such organizations also conduct periodic examinations to 
monitor compliance with such rules.  Broker-dealers are also subject to 
regulation by the state securities law administrators of those states in which 
they conduct business.  Waterhouse Securities is registered as a broker-dealer 
in all fifty states of the United States, the District of Columbia and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  In addition, the Company has registered its 
employees in each of the states in which the Company believes such registration 
is necessary.  However, state broker-dealer registration requirements are often 
subject to ambiguous statutory language and the exercise of broad discretionary 
powers by the administrators of the various state regulatory agencies and the 
failure by the Company to register its representatives in certain states could 
have an adverse effect on the Company's business.  Moreover, the FRB and other 
federal agencies adopt rules that govern various aspects of the securities 
industry.

     As a registered broker-dealer and a member corporation of the NYSE doing 
business with the public, Waterhouse Securities is subject to SEC Rule 15c3-1 
(commonly known as the "Net Capital Rule"), which has also been adopted by the 
NYSE through incorporation by reference in NYSE Rule 325, which specifies the 
minimum amount of net capital required to be maintained by broker-dealers, and 
is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of broker-
dealers and requires that a certain part of broker-dealers' assets be kept in 
relatively liquid form.  The Net Capital Rule imposes financial restrictions on 
broker-dealers which generally are not imposed with respect to organizations 
engaged in other businesses.  Waterhouse Securities may not pay dividends, 
distribute capital, prepay subordinated indebtedness or redeem or repurchase 
shares of its capital stock if, thereafter, it would be in violation of any of 
such rules.

     For purposes of the Net Capital Rule, net capital is essentially defined 
as net worth (total assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated 
indebtedness, less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding 
assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing certain 
other assets, such as positions in securities, conservatively.  Waterhouse 
Securities has at all times maintained net capital in excess of the minimum 
amount of net capital required.

     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") is the primary 
regulator of the Bank.  As such, the Bank is subject to both their monitoring 
and examination.  The OCC has issued guidelines that impose upon national 
banks certain risk-based capital and leverage standards.  Failure to meet 
applicable capital guidelines could subject a national bank to a variety of 
enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities.  
Depending upon circumstances, the regulatory agencies may require an 
institution to surpass minimum capital ratios established and may also take
more restrictive action.

     As a newly chartered bank, the Bank has committed not to pay dividends 
to the Company during its first three years of operation.  Thereafter, the 
National Bank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose various 
restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the 
Company based upon the Bank's net earnings, capital, undivided profits, bad 
debts and losses.

<PAGE> 12

     The Bank assumes the usual risks associated with the management of a 
banking operation including possible fraud.  The Bank's operations are 
highly regulated.  There are various legal limitations on the extent to which 
banks insured by the FDIC can finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of 
their affiliates.  In particular, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions 
on any extensions of credit, or other covered transactions, such as certain 
purchases of assets, with the Company or its affiliates.  Such restrictions 
prevent the Bank from lending to the Company or any of its affiliates unless 
such extensions of credit are secured by U.S. Treasury obligations or other 
specified collateral.

Item 2. Properties
- ------------------

     In January 1993, the Company moved its corporate headquarters to 100 Wall 
Street, New York, New York 10005.  The office also houses the main New York 
branch office and consists of approximately 60,000 square feet of space and
is occupied under a lease which expires in 2002.  The Company's clearing 
operations are located at 44 Street, New York, New York 10005 and consists of 
27,000 square feet of space under a lease that expires in 1997.  The Company 
is currently evaluating various options with respect to the location of its 
clearing operations, including possibly relocating such operations to new 
office space.

     Waterhouse Securities' other 71 branch offices, each of which consist of 
between approximately 800 and 2,100 square feet of space, are located on 
premises covered by leases which expire on various dates through 2004.

     Waterhouse National Bank operates out of its main office in White Plains, 
New York.  It occupies 5,085 square feet under a lease that expires in 1997.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

     Many aspects of the Company's business involve risks of substantial 
liability.  There has been an increased incidence of litigation involving 
securities firms in recent years, including class action suits which generally 
seek substantial damages.  Although Waterhouse Securities has not been named 
as a defendant in any class action suit to date, no assurance can be given 
that it will not be named in the future.  Waterhouse Securities has in the 
past been involved in regulatory proceedings, none of which has had a 
materially adverse effect on its business.  In addition, in the ordinary 
course of business, Waterhouse Securities is occasionally involved in routine 
arbitration proceedings and civil actions arising out of its activities as a 
broker-dealer, an employer or a purchaser of goods and services or arising 
out of alleged employee misconduct, none of which, individually or in the 
aggregate, has had or is expected to have a materially adverse effect on 
its business.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- ------------------------------------------------------------

     No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders 
during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended August 31, 1995.

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On December 1, 1992, the Company's common stock was listed for trading on 
the NYSE.  For the period from February 24, 1992 to November 30, 1992, the 
Company's common stock traded on the AMEX and prior thereto, the Company's 
common stock traded in the over-the-counter market and was included in the 
NASDAQ National Market System ("NASDAQ").  Its current symbol is WHO and 
there are approximately 8,500 holders of record of the common stock.

     The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices on the 
NYSE for the periods indicated.  The Company declared a 25% stock dividend paid 
September 14, 1995 to stockholders of record August 17, 1995, and a 50% stock 
dividend paid November 8, 1993 to stockholders of record October 12, 1993.  
The prices on the table below have been adjusted to reflect the stock dividends 
for the applicable periods (rounded to nearest 1/8).

interest, dividends and the distribution of other amounts by its subsidiaries,
primarily Waterhouse Securities.  However, the payment of cash dividends and 
the distribution of other amounts to the Company by Waterhouse Securities are 
restricted by the rules of the various regulatory agencies as well as various 
state securities law administrators and there is no assurance that dividends 
will be declared and paid or other distributions will be made in the future.  
Additionally, the Company is restricted from receiving dividends from the Bank 
(see Regulation).

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
         --------------------------------------------------------------      
         Results of Operations
         ---------------------

     The Company has experienced rapid growth in customer accounts, trade 
processing activity and revenues.  The Company believes that favorable market 
conditions and increasing participation of individual investors have 
contributed substantially to this growth.  However, the Company also believes 
that its historical growth is attributable in large measure to the expansion 
of its branch office network, the development of the Bank, the introduction 
of new products and services, increased advertising and marketing expenditures, 
and growth in the number of individuals comprising the Company's target market.

     Waterhouse Securities derives substantial revenue from commissions charged 
on securities transactions and from interest earned on customer margin 
balances.  As a result, the revenues and earnings of the Company are directly 
and materially affected by changes in the volume and price 

<PAGE> 18

level of securities transactions, the amount of customer margin loans and the 
Company's cost of funds used to finance such loans.  Accordingly, the Company's 
revenues and earnings have fluctuated materially from quarter to quarter.

     The Company's largest expense category is employee compensation.  The 
Company does not employ commissioned sales representatives, therefore these 
expenses do not vary directly with changes in the Company's trade processing 
activity or commission revenues.  During the past four years, increases in the 
Company's profitability reflect, in part, greater productivity by the Company's 
employees, as total revenues continued to grow more rapidly than the Company's 
employment requirements.

     Communications and data processing charges represent the Company's next 
largest expense category.  However, because the Company uses third party 
vendors to support its order processing activity, these expenses are largely 
variable in nature and fluctuate with changes in the Company's order processing 
activity.

     The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data as 
percentages of total revenues and the percentage increase in each item over the 
amount for the previous period:

Income	

     Commissions and Clearing Fees.  Waterhouse Securities acts as an agent for 
customer trading activity and, therefore, the commissions earned by Waterhouse 
Securities are directly affected by the number of trades executed and cleared, 
as well as the average commission rate per trade.  For the fiscal years ended
August 31, 1995 and 1994, the number of trades executed and cleared by 
Waterhouse Securities increased over the previous year by 26% and 23%, 
respectively, as a result of activity from the addition of new accounts added 
during the periods and increased trading activity from existing accounts.

     Commissions and clearing fees in fiscal year 1995, which amounted to 79% 
of total income, grew to a record $103.5 million, which represented a 25% 
increase over commissions and clearing fees of $83.1 million in fiscal year 
1994.  This trend was a continuation of the growth in commissions and clearing 
fees experienced during fiscal year 1994, which was a 22% increase over fiscal 
year 1993's commissions and clearing fees of $68.3 million.  Included in 
commissions and clearing fees are commissions for directing order execution.  
Due to recent changes in the Securities Industry and the issuance of new 
disclosure requirements by the SEC, no assurance can be given that these 
commissions will continue or that a change in regulations would not have an 
adverse affect on the Company's revenue.

     Net Interest Income.  Waterhouse Securities' primary source of interest 
income is margin loans to customers.  These loans are financed primarily through
capital, bank loans, deposits received for securities loaned, credit balances 
in customer accounts (known as free credit balances) and subordinated debt.  
Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is directly 
affected by the level of such loans, the interest rate charged on those loans, 
which is based on the broker call rate, and the cost of financing.  The Bank 
has contributed to the increase in net interest income due to interest earned 
on short term investments in excess of interest paid to depositors.  Net 
interest income increased for fiscal years 1995 and 1994 by 65% and 44%, 
respectively, from that of the prior years.  Such increase in net interest 
income is a result of an increase in average customer margin loans and a 
lower cost of funds.

     Mutual Fund Revenues.  Included in mutual fund revenues are commission 
fees and loads on mutual fund and money market transfers.  Such revenues 
increased 42% and 41% for fiscal year 1995, and 1994, respectively, over the 
prior years, primarily due to a corresponding increase in volume in mutual 
fund transactions.

Expenses 

     Employee Compensation and Benefits.  Employee compensation represented 
approximately 44% of total operating expenses in fiscal 1995 -- the Company's 
largest expense.  This expense primarily includes salaries, bonuses, ESOP 
contributions and other related benefits and taxes.  Employee compensation 
expense is directly impacted by the number of employees, and partially 
impacted by the profits of the Company, as the bonuses and contributions to the 
ESOP are dependent on income before taxes.

<PAGE> 20

     Employee compensation increased 30% in fiscal 1995 over fiscal 1994, and 
increased 33% in fiscal 1994 over fiscal 1993 primarily as a result of an 
increase in the number of employees from 606 as of August 31, 1993 to 756 as 
of August 31, 1994 to 949 as of August 31, 1995.  These increases were 
necessary to support the rapid branch expansion from 48 as of August 31, 1993 
to 60 as of August 31, 1994 to 72 as of August 31, 1995, as well as increased 
activity from the customer base of the existing branches.  As a percentage of 
total income, employee compensation has remained relatively constant, 33% in 
fiscal 1995, 33% in fiscal 1994 and 31% in fiscal 1993.

     Communications and Data Processing.  This category is primarily composed 
of variable charges related to executing and clearing customer transactions, 
telephone, computer service, and quotation charges.  These charges increased 
28% and 29% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, 
primarily due to the corresponding increase in the volume of transactions 
processed by the Company and, to a lesser extent, the related increases in the 
number of branch offices.

     Advertising and Promotion.  As the branch network expanded at a rapid rate 
over the past two years, Waterhouse Securities increased its advertising 
campaign with larger and more frequent advertising in national publications, 
such as The Wall Street Journal, Barrons and Investors Business Daily.  In 
addition, Waterhouse Securities did a number of direct mail campaigns during 
1995 as well as increased its television advertising campaign on national cable 
television stations that began during fiscal year 1993.  As a result, 
advertising and promotion increased 62% and 25% for fiscal years 1995 and 1994, 
respectively, over the prior years.

     Stationery & Postage.  This includes envelopes, postage charges and 
stationery for our brokerage operations.  This expense increased 60% in 
fiscal 1995 from fiscal 1994, and increased 10% from fiscal 1993.  
The 1995 increase is attributable to the large increase in trade volume, as
well as the development of new customer statements, both of which caused a 
large increase in postage expense.

     Clearing Fees.  This expense increased 10% in fiscal 1995 from fiscal 
1994 as well as 10% in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993.  This includes both 
clearance and floor brokerage expense and was affected by the increase in 
the trade volume.

     Occupancy.  Occupancy expense increased 19% in fiscal 1995 from fiscal 
1994 and 34% in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993.  These increases were primarily 
attributable to an increase in rental expense attributable to the expansion of 
the Company's branch office network and an increase in space required for the 
Company's clearing operations and corporate headquarters during fiscal years 
1995 and 1994.

     All Other Expenses.  Included in other expenses are equipment purchases, 
depreciation and amortization, insurance, professional fees and other 
miscellaneous expenses.  Other expenses, amounted to $14.2 million, $10.0 
million and $5.8 million in fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively, 
resulting in increases of 42% and 73% in fiscal years 1995 and 1994, 
respectively.  These increases are primarily attributable to the general 
expansion of the Company's business during the period.

Financial Condition

     As of August 31, 1995, the Company's financial position remained strong 
with over 97% of total assets consisting of cash, deposits, investment 
securities and receivables.  The Company's assets primarily consist of 
investment securities, deposits and receivables from broker-dealers and 
customers.  Customer receivables of $369 million at August 31, 1995 are 
secured by readily marketable securities, some of which are used to 
collateralize bankloans of $40 million and deposits received for securities 
loaned of $108 million.  The Company's other assets consist principally of 
office and operating equipment.

     Stockholders' equity as of August 31, 1995 was $66.7 million, an increase 
of $17.1 million since August 31, 1994.  Such increase was primarily due to 
earnings less dividends during the year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

     The Company had available formal and informal lines of credit of 
approximately $255 million (of which $40 million was utilized) at August 31, 
1995, which require collateralization upon utilization.  These lines of credit, 
along with deposits received for securities loaned and free credit balances, 
are the primary sources of liquidity for the Company.  Management believes that 
these primary sources of liquidity, along with the equity of the Company, are 
sufficient to meet the short and long-term financing needs of the Company based 
on its present and anticipated future operations.

     On December 21, 1993, the Company issued $50,000,000 of 6% Convertible 
Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due December 15, 2003.  The Notes are 
convertible by the holders into the Company's common stock at any time prior 
to maturity, at a conversion price of $23.40, subject to adjustment.  The notes 
are also redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any 
time on or after December 15, 1996.

     The following chart sets forth the redemption prices (expressed as 
percentages of the principal amount), if redeemed by the Company during the 
twelve-month period beginning December 15 of the year indicated.

     Proceeds from the offering, which amounted to $48,551,000, are being used 
to increase the working capital of the Company's subsidiaries.  The $1,449,000 
in  issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the Notes.  In 
addition, the Company retired $1,500,000 in Notes during the third quarter 
fiscal 1994.  This purchase resulted in a net capital gain of $242,000.

     As a bank holding company, the Company closely monitors its capital levels 
to provide for normal business needs and to comply with regulatory 
requirements.  As summarized below, the Company's capital ratios were in 
excess of the regulatory requirements to be deemed "Well Capitalized" for the
period ended August 31, 1995.

     Waterhouse Securities is subject to rules adopted by the SEC, the NYSE, 
the NASD and various state securities law administrators which are designed to 
measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of broker-dealers by 
determining the amount of their net capital.  Waterhouse Securities may not pay 
dividends, distribute capital, prepay subordinated indebtedness or redeem or 
repurchase shares of its capital stock if, thereafter, it would be in violation 
of any of such rules.  In the past, Waterhouse Securities has at all times 
maintained net capital in excess of the minimum amount of net capital required 
to be maintained by such rules, and, as of August 31, 1995, Waterhouse 
Securities had net capital in the amount of $39,415,877, which exceeded the 
minimum amount of net capital required to be maintained by $31,495,253.

Effects of Inflation

     For the three year period ended August 31, 1995, there was no material 
effect on the Company due to inflation.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- ----------------------------------------------------


                  RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The management of Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. is responsible for 
the financial statements and other financial information contained in this 
report.  The Company believes that the financial statements have been prepared 
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate under 
the circumstances to reflect, in all material respects, the substance of 
applicable events and transactions.  In preparing the financial statements, 
it is necessary that management make informed estimates and judgments.  
The other financial information in this annual report is consistent with 
the financial statements.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting control designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for purposes 
of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly accounted for 
and safeguarded.  The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the 
recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to 
be derived.  The Company believes its system provides an appropriate balance 
in this regard.  The Company maintains compliance and internal auditing 
departments which review the adequacy and test the application of internal 
accounting controls.

     The financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse LLP, 
independent accountants, for the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994, and 
1993.  Their reports express opinions that the Company's financial statements 
are fairly stated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that their audits were performed in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards which are designed to obtain reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement.

     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, consisting 
solely of outside directors, meets with the independent accountants, 
compliance personnel, internal auditors and management to discuss, among 
other things, the audit scopes and results.  The independent accountants and 
the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee, 
with or without the presence of management.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.


     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial 
condition and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in 
stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. and its 
subsidiaries at August 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations 
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 
31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform 
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.  
Deposits paid for securities borrowed transactions require the Company to 
deposit cash with the lender.  With respect to deposits received for securities 
loaned, the Company receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount 
generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned.  The Company 
monitors the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned on a daily 
basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded, as necessary.

     Furniture and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation.  Furniture and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, between two and five years.

     All share and per share amounts have been restated to give retroactive 
effect to a 25% stock dividend paid September 14, 1995 to shareholders of 
record August 17, 1995, a 50% stock dividend paid November 8, 1993 to 
stockholders of record October 12, 1993, and a 25% stock dividend paid by the 
Company March 3, 1993 to stockholders of record February 10, 1993.  However, 
the number of shares outstanding, the related common stock and retained 
earnings amounts as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Condition and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for 
the years ended August 31, 1994 and 1993 have not been retroactively restated
for the stock dividends subsequent to the respective fiscal year ends.

     Primary earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share have been 
computed based upon a total of 11,512,427 and 13,669,937 respectively, weighted 
average shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents for the 
year ended August 31, 1995, 11,461,829

and 12,960,629 respectively, weighted average shares of common stock 
outstanding and common stock equivalents for the year ended August 31, 1994 
and 11,439,441 weighted average shares of common stock outstanding and common 
stock equivalents for the year ended August 31, 1993.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosure about 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires the disclosure of the fair 
value of financial instruments, including assets and liabilities recognized 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.  The Company's 6% 
Convertible Subordinated Notes, which are reflected on the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Condition at the principal value of $48,500,000, are 
listed on the NYSE, and, as of August 31, 1995 and August 31, 1994, had an 
aggregate fair market value of $49,833,750 and $38,254,375, respectively.  
Additionally, investment securities held by the bank are carried at amortized
cost, which as of August 31, 1995 and 1994, approximates their market values 
(Note 3).  Management estimates that the aggregate net fair value of all 
other financial instruments recognized on the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Condition (including deposits received for securities loaned and 
deposits paid for securities borrowed, receivables and payables and broker 
loans) approximates their carrying value, as such financial instruments are 
short term in nature, bear interest at current market rates or are subject 
to repricing.


NOTE 2 - RECLASSIFICATION
- -------------------------

     The consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the years 
ended August 31, 1994 and August 31, 1993 have been reclassified to conform 
with the presentation adopted for the year ended August 31, 1995 because of the 
Company's registration as a bank holding company.  Certain prior period amounts 
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.


NOTE 3 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES
- ------------------------------ 

     The Investment securities are held by Waterhouse National Bank and carried 
at amortized cost since the bank has the intent and the ability to hold these 
instruments to maturity.  The maturity of these instruments range from 
September 6, 1995 to June 26, 2000.  The following is a comparison of the 
carrying amount and approximate market values:

NOTE 10 - CAPITAL ADEQUACY	
- --------------------------

     As a registered broker-dealer and member firm of the NYSE, the Broker is 
subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (the "Rule") which requires the 
maintenance of minimum net capital.  The Broker has elected to use the 
alternative method, permitted by the Rule, which requires that the Broker 
maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of 
aggregate debit items arising from customer transactions.  Additionally, the 
NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is 
less than 4% of aggregate debit items and may prohibit the Broker from 
expanding its business and declaring dividends if its net capital is less 
than 5% of aggregate debit items.

     At August 31, 1995, the Broker had net capital of $39,415,877, which was 
10% of aggregate debit items and $31,495,253 in excess of required net 
capital.  Further, the amounts in excess of 4% and 5% of aggregate debit 
items were $23,574,629 and $19,614,317, respectively.

     As a bank holding company, the Company closely monitors its capital levels 
and the capital levels of the Bank to provide for normal business needs and to 
comply with regulatory requirements.  Both the Company's and the Bank's capital 
ratios were in excess of the regulatory requirements to be deemed "Well 
Capitalized" for the period ended August 31, 1995.

NOTE 11 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN 
- ---------------------------------------

     The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") which enables 
employees, who have completed at least one year of service, to acquire shares 
of the Company's common stock.  In the past, the acquisition of the Company's 
common stock by the ESOP has been funded by (1) discretionary contributions by 
the Company, (2) loans to the ESOP from banks, which are guaranteed by the 
Company, and (3) loans to the ESOP from the Company.  Common stock purchased by 
the ESOP with loan proceeds was pledged as collateral against the loan and 
allocated to individual participant accounts as the principal balance of the 
loan was repaid.  All shares are held by the ESOP for the accounts of 
participants until such time as the participant retires or otherwise ceases 
to be employed by the Company.  The Company is required to make contributions 
to the ESOP in amounts which are sufficient to meet the ESOP's current 
obligations, including principal and interest payments on the ESOP's debt, 
as applicable.  As of August 31, 1995 the ESOP had no outstanding loans.

     The ESOP held 1,419,148 and 1,459,008 shares of the Company's common stock 
at August 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively and $2,155,000 principal value of 6% 
Convertible Subordinated Notes of the Company at August 31, 1995.

     The Company had recorded deferred compensation - ESOP for the cost of the 
shares purchased with the proceeds of the loans to the ESOP.  The Company 
reduced deferred compensation - ESOP as the loans were repaid and the 
related shares allocated to participants' accounts and recognized expense to 
the extent of contributions to the ESOP.  The total expense recognized by 
the Company with respect to the ESOP, excluding dividends used for debt 
service, for the years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $2,188,011, 
$1,840,042 and $768,958, respectively.

NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES
- ----------------------

     The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax 
return on a fiscal year basis.  The Company's income taxes are computed under 
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 
"Accounting for Income Taxes".  The following is a reconciliation of the 
provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the Federal 
statutory rate to income before income taxes.

     During the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993, the Company reduced the 
amount of its current tax liability and increased its additional paid in 
capital by $1,398,433, due to a Federal income tax credit arising from the 
exercise of certain stock options.  This credit had no effect on the 
Company's tax expense or net income for that year.

NOTE 13 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK AND CONCENTRATION 
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
          OF CREDIT RISK
          --------------

     In the normal course of business, the Broker executes, as agent, 
securities transactions on behalf of its customers.  If either  counterparty 
fails to perform, the Broker may be required to discharge the obligations of 
the nonperforming party.  In such circumstances, the Broker may sustain a
loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract value 
of the transaction.

     In the normal course of business, the Broker may deliver securities as 
collateral in support of various secured financing sources such as bank loans 
and deposits paid for securities loaned.  Additionally, the Broker delivers 
customer securities as collateral to satisfy margin deposits of various
clearing organizations.  In the event the counterparty is unable to meet its 
contract obligation to return customer securities delivered as collateral, 
the Broker may be obligated to purchase the securities in order to return 
them to the owner.  In such circumstances, the Broker may incur a loss up to 
the amount by which the market value of the securities exceeds the value of 
the loan or other collateral received or in the possession or control of the 
Broker.

     For transactions in which the Broker extends credit to customers, the 
Broker seeks to control the risks associated with these activities by requiring 
customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory 
and internal guidelines.  The Broker monitors required margin levels daily and, 
pursuant to such guidelines, requests customers to deposit additional 
collateral or reduce securities positions, when necessary.

     The Broker has a nationwide retail customer base.  The Broker conducts 
business with brokers and dealers, clearing organizations and depositories that 
are primarily located in the New York area.  Banking activities are conducted 
mainly with commercial banks to support customer securities activities at 
branch office locations.  The majority of the Broker's transactions and, 
consequently, the concentration of its credit exposures are with customers, 
broker-dealers and other financial institutions in the United States.  These 
result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to fulfill
its contractual obligations, the Broker's exposure to credit risk can be 
directly impacted by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability 
of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations.  The Broker seeks 
to control its credit risk through a variety of reporting and control 
procedures, including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the 
counterparties' financial condition and credit ratings.  The Broker monitors 
collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal 
guidelines and requests changes in collateral levels, as appropriate.
