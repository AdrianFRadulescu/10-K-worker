ITEM   1.    BUSINESS.

                                    GENERAL

              The registrant, Union Electric Company (the "Company"),
incorporated in Missouri in 1922, is successor to a number of companies, the
oldest of which was organized in 1881.  The Company, which is the largest
electric utility in the State of Missouri, supplies electric service in
territories in Missouri and Illinois having an estimated population of
2,600,000 within an area of approximately 24,500 square miles, including the
greater St. Louis area.  Natural gas purchased from non-affiliated pipeline
companies is distributed in 90 Missouri communities and in the City of Alton,
Illinois and vicinity.

              For the year 1994, 95.8% of total operating revenues was derived
from the sale of electric energy and 4.2% from the sale of natural gas.
Electric operating revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues for the
years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 were 95.9%, 95.7%, 95.7%, and 95.2%
respectively.

              The Company employed 6,266 persons at December 31, 1994.
Approximately 70% of the Company's employees are represented by local unions
affiliated with the AFL-CIO.  Labor agreements representing approximately 4,300
employees will expire in 1996.  Two agreements covering 120 employees will
expire in 1997.



                       CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND FINANCING

              The Company is engaged in a construction program under which
expenditures averaging approximately $290 million are anticipated during each
of the next five years.  Capital expenditures for compliance with the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 are included in the construction program -- also see
"Regulation", below.  The Company does not anticipate a need for additional
base load electric generating capacity until after the year 2013.

              During the five-year period ended 1994 gross additions to the
property of the Company, including allowance for funds used during construction
and excluding nuclear fuel, were approximately $1.3 billion (including $314
million in 1994) and property retirements were $197 million.

              In addition to the funds required for construction during the
1995-1999 period, $248 million will be required to repay long-term debt and
preferred stock as follows:  $68 million in 1995, $35 million in 1996, $45
million in 1997, and $100 million in 1999.  Amounts for years subsequent to
1995 do not include nuclear fuel lease payments since the amounts of such
payments are not currently determinable.

              For information on the Company's external cash sources, see
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis"
on Page 18 of the 1994 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference.

              FINANCING RESTRICTIONS.  Under the most restrictive earnings test
contained in the Company's principal Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust
("Mortgage") relating to its First Mortgage Bonds ("Bonds"), no Bonds may be
issued (except in certain refunding operations) unless the Company's net
earnings available for interest after depreciation for 12 consecutive months
within the 15 months preceding such issuance are at least two times annual
interest charges on all Bonds and prior lien bonds then outstanding and to be
issued (all calculated as provided in the Mortgage).  Such ratio for the 12
months ended December 31, 1994 was 6.5, which would permit the Company to issue
an additional $2.7 billion of Bonds (8 1/2% annual interest rate assumed).
Additionally, the Mortgage permits issuance of new bonds up to (a) 60% of
defined property additions, or (b) the amount of previous bonds retired or to
be retired, or (c) the amount of cash put up for such purpose.  At December 31,
1994, the aggregate amount of Bonds issuable under (a) and (b) above was
approximately $1.6 billion.  The Company's Articles of Incorporation restrict
the Company from selling Preferred Stock unless its net earnings for a period
of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding such sale are at least two
and one-half times the annual dividend requirements on its Preferred Stock then
outstanding and to be issued.  Such ratio for the 12 months ended December 31,
1994 was 24.0, which would permit the Company to issue an additional $1.3
billion stated value of Preferred Stock (8 1/2% annual dividend rate assumed).
Certain other financing arrangements require the Company to obtain prior
consents to various actions by the Company, including any future borrowings,
except for permitted financings such as borrowings under revolving credit
agreements, the nuclear fuel lease, unsecured short-term borrowings (subject to
certain conditions), and the issuance of additional Bonds.


                                     RATES

              For the year 1994, approximately 89%, 8%, and 3% of the Company's
electric operating revenues were based on rates regulated by Missouri Public
Service Commission, Illinois Commerce Commission, and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ("FERC") of the Department of Energy, respectively.

</TABLE>

           COAL.  Because of uncertainties of supply due to potential work
stoppages, equipment breakdowns and other factors, the Company has a policy of
maintaining a coal inventory of 75 days, based on normal annual burn practices.
See "Regulation" for additional reference to the Company's coal requirements.

           NUCLEAR.  The components of the nuclear fuel cycle required for
nuclear generating units are as follows:  (1) uranium; (2) conversion of
uranium into uranium hexafluoride; (3) enrichment



                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>   5

of uranium hexafluoride; (4) conversion of enriched uranium hexafluoride into
uranium dioxide and the fabrication into nuclear fuel assemblies; and (5)
disposal and/or reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.

           The Company has agreements to fulfill its needs for uranium,
enrichment, and fabrication services through 1999.  The Company's agreements
for conversion services are sufficient to supply the Callaway Plant through
1997.  Additional contracts will have to be entered into in order to supply
nuclear fuel during the remainder of the life of the Plant, at prices which
cannot now be accurately predicted.  The Callaway Plant normally requires
re-fueling at 18-month intervals and re-fuelings are presently scheduled for
the spring of 1995 and fall of 1996.

           Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U. S. Department of
Energy ("DOE") is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent
nuclear fuel.  DOE currently charges one mill per kilowatt-hour sold for future
disposal of spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide for
recovery of such costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage
facility for spent fuel available until at least 2010.  The Company has
sufficient storage capacity at the Callaway Plant site until 2005 and has
viable storage alternatives under consideration.  Each alternative will likely
require Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval and may require other regulatory
approvals.  The delayed availability of DOE's disposal facility is not expected
to adversely affect the continued operation of the Callaway Plant.

           OIL AND GAS.  The actual and prospective use of such fuels is
minimal, and the Company has not experienced and does not expect to experience
difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies.



                                   REGULATION

           The Company is subject to regulation by the Missouri Commission and
Illinois Commission as to rates, service, accounts, issuance of equity
securities, issuance of debt having a maturity of more than twelve months, and
various other matters.  The Company is also subject to regulation by the FERC
as to rates and charges in connection with the transmission of electric energy
in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate
commerce, and certain other matters.  Authorization to issue debt having a
maturity of twelve months or less is obtained from the FERC.

           Operation of the Company's Callaway Plant is subject to regulation
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The Company's Facility Operating License
for the Callaway Plant expires on October 18, 2024.

           The Company's Osage hydroelectric plant and its Taum Sauk
pumped-storage hydro plant, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act,
are subject to certain federal regulations affecting, among other things, the
general operation and maintenance of the projects.  The Company's license for
the Osage Plant expires on February 28, 2006, and its license for the Taum Sauk
Plant expires on June 30, 2010.  The Company's Keokuk Plant and dam located in
the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated
under authority, unlimited in time, granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

           The Company is exempt from the provisions of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, except Section 9(a)(2) relating to the acquisition
of securities of other public utility



                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>   6

companies and Section 11(b)(2) with respect to concluding matters relating to
the 1974 acquisition of the common stock of a former subsidiary.  When the
Securities and Exchange Commission approved such acquisition it reserved
jurisdiction to pass upon the right of the Company to retain its gas
properties.

           The Company is regulated, in certain of its operations, by air and
water pollution and hazardous waste regulations at the city, county, state and
federal levels.  The Company is in substantial compliance with such existing
regulations.

           Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required
to significantly reduce total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by the year
2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  With
switching to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company
anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
significant increase in revenue needs because the related capital costs,
currently estimated at about $300 million, will be largely offset by lower fuel
costs.  As of the end of 1994 about 65% of the Clean Air Act related capital
costs had been expended.

           As of December 31, 1994, the Company was designated a potentially
responsible party ("PRP") by federal or state environmental protection agencies
for five hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been
identified for which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated
a PRP.  The Company continually reviews the remedial costs that will be
required for these sites.  However, such costs are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

           Other aspects of the Company's business are subject to the
jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities.



                                INDUSTRY ISSUES

           The Company is facing issues common to the electric and gas utility
industries which have emerged during the past several years.  These issues
include:  changes in the structure of the industry as a result of amendments to
federal laws regulating ownership of generating facilities and access to
transmission systems; the potential for more intense competition; continually
developing environmental laws, regulations and issues; public concern about the
siting of new facilities; increasing public attention on the potential public
health consequences of exposure to electric and magnetic fields emanating from
power lines and other electric sources; proposals for demand side management
programs; and public concerns about the disposal of nuclear wastes and about
global climate issues.  The Company is monitoring these issues and is unable to
predict at this time what impact, if any, these issues will have on its
operations or financial condition.

           In planning its construction program, the Company is presently
utilizing a forecast of kilowatthour sales growth of approximately 1.8% and
peak load growth of 1.1%, each compounded annually, and is providing for a
minimum reserve margin of approximately 18% to 22% above its anticipated peak
load requirements.

           See "Operating Statistics", incorporated by reference in Part I of
this Form 10-K, for information on loads and capability during the five-year
period ended 1994.

           See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" under "Management's Discussion
and Analysis" on Page 18 of the 1994 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by
reference for information on the 1992 purchase and sale of certain properties.

           The Company is a member of one of the nine regional electric
reliability councils organized for coordinating the planning and operation of
the nation's bulk power supply - MAIN (Mid-America Interconnected Network)
operating primarily in Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri.  The Company has
interconnections for the exchange of power, directly and through the facilities
of

others, with fifteen private utilities and with Associated Electric
Cooperative, Inc., the City of Columbia, Missouri, the Southwestern Power
Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

           The Company owns 40% of the capital stock of Electric Energy, Inc.
("EEI"), the balance of which is held by three other sponsoring companies --
Kentucky Utilities Company ("KU"), Central Illinois Public Service Company
("CIPS"), and Illinois Power Company ("IP").  EEI owns and operates a
generating plant with a nominal capacity of 1,000 mW.  As of January 1, 1994,
60% of the plant's output is committed to the Paducah Project of the DOE, 20%
is committed to KU, 10% to the Company, and 5% each to IP and CIPS.

           As of December 31, 1994, the Company owned approximately 3,315
circuit miles of electric transmission lines and substations with a transformer
capacity of approximately 44,697,000 kVA.  The Company owns four propane-air
plants with an aggregate daily natural gas equivalent capacity of 31,590
million cubic feet and 2,590 miles of gas mains.  Other properties of the
Company include distribution lines, underground cable, steam distribution
facilities in Jefferson City, Missouri and office buildings, warehouses,
garages and repair shops.

           The Company has fee title to all principal plants and other
important units of property, or to the real property on which such facilities
are located (subject to mortgage liens securing outstanding indebtedness of the
Company and to permitted liens and judgment liens, as defined), except that (i)
a portion of the Osage Plant reservoir, certain facilities at the Sioux Plant,
certain of the Company's substations and most of its transmission and
distribution lines and gas mains are situated on lands occupied under leases,
easements, franchises, licenses or permits; (ii) the United States and/or the
State of Missouri own, or have or may have, paramount rights to certain lands
lying in the bed of the Osage River or located between the inner and outer
harbor lines of the Mississippi River, on which certain generating and other
properties of the Company are located; and (iii) the United States and/or State
of Illinois and/or State of Iowa and/or City of Keokuk, Iowa own, or have or
may have, paramount rights with respect to, certain lands lying in the bed of
the Mississippi River on which a portion of the Company's Keokuk Plant is
located.

           Substantially all of the Company's property and plant is subject to
the direct first lien of an Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated June
15, 1937, as amended and supplemented.  As part of the 1983 merger of the
Company with its utility subsidiaries, the Company assumed the mortgage
indenture of each subsidiary.  Currently, the prior liens of two former
subsidiary indentures extend to the property and franchises acquired by the
Company from such subsidiaries.  Such indentures also contain provisions
subjecting to the prior lien thereof after-acquired property of the Company
constituting (with certain exceptions) additions, extensions, improvements,
repairs, and replacements appurtenant to property acquired in the merger.  In
addition, one such indenture contains a provision subjecting to the prior lien
thereof after-acquired property of the Company situated in the territory served
by the former subsidiary prior to the merger.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

       The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary
course of business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  Management is
of the opinion that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

                        ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE





To the Board of Directors
of Union Electric Company



Our audits of the financial statements referred to in our report dated January

31, 1995 appearing in the 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders of Union Electric

Company (which report and financial statements are incorporated by reference in

this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an audit of the Financial

Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion,

this Financial Statement Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,

the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related

financial statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings and earnings per share fluctuated due to many conditions, the primary
ones being: weather variations, electric rate reductions, sales growth,
fluctuating operating costs, the purchase and sales of utility properties, new
accounting requirements, changes in interest expense and in income and property
taxes.

The impacts of the more significant items affecting revenues, costs, and
earnings during the past several years are analyzed and discussed below.

The increase in 1994 electric revenues reflects growth in sales to commercial
and industrial customers, offset by reduced sales to residential customers,
primarily due to milder weather in the first and third quarters of 1994
compared to 1993.

The increase in 1993 electric revenues primarily reflects increased sales from
colder, more normal winter weather in the first quarter 1993 followed by warmer
spring and summer weather when compared to 1992.  These increased revenues were
partially offset by the November 1992 Missouri rate settlement effective
January 1, 1993, which decreased rates for all Missouri electric customers and
reduced annual revenues by approximately $42 million.  The sale of the
Company's Iowa and northern Illinois retail properties in December 1992 reduced
1993 electric revenues $52 million which was offset by growth in other service
areas, including the territory purchased from Arkansas Power & Light Company in
March 1992.  The lower 1992 electric revenues were primarily due to unusually
mild summer weather which reduced air conditioning use as compared to 1991.

The variation in electric revenues attributable to growth and other factors in
1992, 1993, and 1994 primarily reflects the differences in economic growth in
the Company's service territory for these periods.  In 1992, normalized
kilowatthour sales increased 3.2% compared to 1991, which reflects both an
improved local economy and the addition of new customers resulting from the
purchase of the Missouri distribution properties of Arkansas Power & Light
Company in March 1992.  In 1993, normalized kilowatthour sales decreased 0.8%
reflecting the loss of sales from disposition of our Iowa and northern Illinois
service territory partially offset by an improved local economy.  In 1994,
normalized kilowatthour sales were 2.9% over 1993, demonstrating an improving
local economy.  Other less significant factors contributing to variations in
electric sales are conservation, installation of energy efficient appliances,
and changes to and from alternative fuels.

</TABLE>

The decreased 1994 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect lower fuel prices
from burning low-sulfur coal at our fossil fuel power plants and greater
Callaway Plant generation due to the absence of a nuclear refueling outage in
1994.  Higher generation, resulting in greater fuel costs, was more than offset
by reduced net purchased power costs and increased generating efficiencies.
The increased 1993 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect increased purchased
power and lower generating efficiencies offset  in part by greater hydro
generation and reduced fossil-fueled generation.  Increased power purchases
from other utilities were required in 1993 when flooding interrupted coal
deliveries to several of the Company's fossil-fueled power plants.  The
decreased 1992 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect reduced generation
associated with lower electric sales and a Callaway refueling outage in 1992,
greater hydro generation and lower fuel prices, offset in part by greater net
purchased power costs.

Other variations in 1992 through 1994 operating expenses reflect recurring
conditions such as growth, inflation, and wage and benefit increases.  In 1994,
operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs decreased $10
million, primarily due to a $7 million reduction of natural gas

                                      16

purchased for resale, a $5 million decrease in labor costs and a $3 million
decrease in employee benefit expenses, partially offset by increased provision
for injuries and damages and higher consulting and communication expenses.  In
1993, operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, increased
$64 million, primarily due to a $32 million increase in employee postretirement
benefits expense pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than
Pensions", a $14 million increase in natural gas purchased for resale, a $5
million increase in labor costs, and higher pensions, professional and computer
services, regulatory fees, and provision for injuries and damages.  In 1992,
operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, increased $7
million, primarily reflecting a $5 million increase in labor costs, a $4
million increase in employee benefit expenses, a $2 million increase in natural
gas purchased for resale, offset in part by a $5 million decrease in nuclear
spent fuel disposal cost, primarily due to the refueling outage at Callaway
Plant and a refund of overcharges from the Department of Energy.

In 1994, maintenance expenses increased $8 million primarily due to increased
maintenance expenses at our fossil fuel power plants and greater tree trimming
expense, partially offset by lower Callaway Plant maintenance (no refueling
outage in 1994) and reduced labor costs.  In 1993, maintenance expenses
increased $3 million primarily due to flood-related labor expenses.  In 1992,
maintenance expenses increased $17 million, due to a $20 million increase in
Callaway Plant maintenance expenses primarily associated with Callaway's fifth
refueling, partially offset by reduced maintenance at other fossil-fueled
generating plants.

Depreciation expenses increased $6 million in each of the years 1994 and 1993,
due to increased depreciable property.  Depreciation expense increased $10
million in 1992, primarily due to the purchase of the Missouri distribution
properties of Arkansas Power & Light Company in early 1992, a $3 million
increase in nuclear plant decommissioning expense and increased other
depreciable property.

Income taxes from operations in 1994 increased $27 million due to higher
pre-tax income and a higher effective Missouri income tax rate.  Income taxes
from operations in 1993 reflect a higher federal income tax rate offset by
lower pre-tax income.  Income taxes from operations decreased $43 million in
1992 due principally to lower pre-tax income.

In 1994, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $4 million,
primarily due to increased real estate taxes and greater corporate franchise
taxes.  In 1993, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $6
million, primarily due to higher gross receipts and real estate taxes.  In
1992, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $3 million due to a
$7 million increase in real estate taxes, partially offset by a $4 million
reduction in gross receipts taxes associated with lower revenues.

CALLAWAY RATE PHASE-IN PLANS
See Note 1 under Notes to Financial Statements for information relative to
Callaway rate phase-in plans.

INTEREST
In 1994 interest expense increased $12 million, primarily due to greater amount
of total debt outstanding and higher interest rates on variable rate debt.  In
1993 and 1992 interest expenses decreased $6 million, and $32 million,
respectively, primarily due to the refinancing of high-cost debt with lower
cost issues, lower interest rates on variable rate debt and a reduction in
total debt outstanding.

CONTINGENCIES
See Note 10 under Notes to Financial Statements for material issues existing at
December 31, 1994 that could affect the Company.

The Company completed the construction of its Callaway Plant in late 1984.
Additional base load electric generation capacity is not anticipated until
after the year 2013.  In addition to funds required for construction
expenditures during the 1995-1999 periods, $248 million will be required to
repay long-term debt and preferred stock maturities.

Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to
significantly reduce total annual emissions of

                                      17

<PAGE>   3

sulfur dioxide by the year 2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will
also be required.  With switching to low-sulfur coal and early banking of
emission credits, the Company anticipates that it can comply with the
requirements of the law with no significant revenue increases because the
related capital costs, estimated at about $300 million, are largely offset by
lower fuel costs.  At December 31, 1994 about 65 percent of the Clean Air Act
related capital costs had been expended.

On March 12, 1992, the Company purchased the Missouri retail electric
distribution properties of Arkansas Power & Light Company (a subsidiary of
Entergy Corporation) for $63 million.  This acquisition increased the Company's
customers by 26,000 in 10 counties in southeastern Missouri adjacent to the
Company's existing service territory.  In connection with the transaction, the
Company entered into a long-term power purchase agreement with AP&L which
allows the Company to serve the new customers cost-effectively and without
building additional generating capacity.

In December 1992, the Company sold its Iowa retail and wholesale electric
distribution properties to Iowa Electric Light & Power (a subsidiary of IES
Industries, Inc.) and its northern Illinois electric distribution properties to
Central Illinois Public Service Company.  The Company served approximately
21,000 customers in the areas sold.  The net book value of the properties sold
was $34 million.  Sales proceeds totaled $68 million.  As a result of these
sales, the Company realized a gain in 1992 of $18 million, net of tax.  The
Company's hydroelectric generating station near Keokuk, Iowa and related
transmission facilities were not included in the sales.

A nuclear fuel lease agreement provides financing for the Company's nuclear
fuel requirements.  Effective February 1, 1994, the maximum which can be
financed under the agreement was increased from $100 million to $120 million.
At December 31, 1994, $118 million of nuclear fuel was financed under the
lease.

The Company plans to continue utilizing short-term debt as support for normal
operations and other temporary requirements (see Note 3 under Notes to
Financial Statements).  The Company is authorized by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to have outstanding at any one time up to $600 million of
short-term unsecured debt instruments.

TAX MATTERS
See Income Taxes in Note 7 under Notes to Financial Statements regarding
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes."

ABOUT THE DIVIDEND
The Board of Directors does not set specific targets or payout parameters for
the Company's dividend payments.  In their annual review of dividend payments,
however, the Board considers various issues, including the following:  the
Company's historic earnings and cash flow; the Company's projected earnings,
cash flow and potential cash flow requirements; dividend increases among other
utilities; return on investments with similar risk characteristics, and overall
business considerations.  In 1994, Union Electric paid 79.6 percent of its
earnings to its common stockholders.

ABOUT OUR STRATEGY
The Company's management and Board of Directors recognize the increasing
probability of more intense competition in the utility industry in the future.
Although no one can accurately predict the time or precise nature of this
competition, the Company operates its business assuming this competition will
occur.  Union Electric's basic business strategy is threefold: 1) to improve
our competitive position by continually enhancing customer service; 2) to
maintain competitive electricity rates, and 3) to reduce costs to the lowest
levels possible without compromising customer service, employee safety,
environmental stewardship, fair returns to stockholders and fair rewards to
employees.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
The current replacement cost of the Company's utility plant substantially
exceeds its recorded historical cost.  Under existing regulatory practice, only
the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As a result, cash
flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs through
depreciation may not be adequate to replace plant in future years.  However,
past practice indicates the Company will be allowed to earn on and to recover
the increased cost of replacement facilities when replacement occurs.  The
impact on common stockholders is mitigated to the extent depreciable property
is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of less purchasing power.

(a)   At December 31, 1994, substantially all of the property and plant was
      mortgaged under, and subject to liens of, the respective indentures
      pursuant to which the bonds were issued.
(b)   Environmental Improvement Series.
(c)   A bank credit agreement due 1999 permits the Company to borrow up to $200
      million. Interest rates will vary depending on market conditions  and the
      Company's selection of various options under the agreement. At December
      31, 1994, no such borrowings were outstanding.
(d)   A bank credit agreement due 1997 permits the Company to borrow or to
      support commercial paper borrowings up to $300 million.  Interest rates
      will vary depending on market conditions.  At December 31, 1994, no such
      borrowings were outstanding.
(e)   On June 1 of each year, the interest rate is established for the
      following year, or alternatively at the option of the Company, may be
      fixed until  maturity. A per annum rate of 3.75% is effective for the
      year ending May 31, 1995.  Thereafter, interest rates will depend on
      market conditions  and the selection of an annual versus remaining life
      rate by the Company.
(f)   Interest rates, and the periods during which such rates apply, vary
      depending on the Company's selection of certain defined rate modes.  The
      average interest rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994, for
      1985 Series A, 1985 Series B, 1991 Series and 1992 Series bonds  were
      2.85%, 2.91%, 3.07% and 3.12%, respectively.
(g)   In addition to Nuclear Fuel Lease Long-Term Debt, at December 31, 1994
      and 1993, $30 million and $31 million, respectively, were included under
      current maturity of long-term debt.
(h)   The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1994 is
      $1,728,346,000. This estimate is based primarily on market values of
      actual  or comparable securities at year end. The estimate may not
      represent actual values of financial instruments that could have been
      realized as of year end or that may be realized in the future.

Net Income and Earnings on Common Stock for the fourth quarter of 1993 reflect
the Callaway Plant refueling, the effect of which decreased earnings on common
stock by about $21 million ($.20 per share). The cost of flooding in the
Company's service territory in 1993 reduced earnings on common stock by $10
million ($.10 per share), primarily in the third quarter.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission, Illinois
Commerce Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The
accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with the rate-making
practices of the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction and, as such,
conform to generally accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated
public utilities.  Following is a description of the Company's significant
accounting policies:

PROPERTY AND PLANT
The cost of additions to and betterments of units of property and plant is
capitalized.  Cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, and overheads,
plus an allowance for funds used during construction.  Maintenance expenditures
and the renewal of items not considered units of property are charged to income
as incurred.  When units of depreciable property are retired, the original cost
and removal cost, less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.

DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various classes of
depreciable property by applying composite rates on a straight-line basis.  The
provision for depreciation in 1994, 1993, and 1992 was approximately 3% of the
average depreciable cost.

NUCLEAR FUEL
The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a unit-of-production
basis.  Spent fuel disposal cost is charged to expense based on kilowatthours
sold.

INCOME TAXES
Effective January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of
transactions that have been treated differently for financial reporting and tax
return purposes, measured using statutory tax rates.  

Investment tax credits utilized in prior years were deferred and are being
amortized over the useful lives of the properties to which they relate.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC) is a utility industry
accounting practice whereby the cost of borrowed funds and the cost of equity
funds (preferred and common stockholders' equity) applicable to the Company's
construction program are capitalized as a cost of construction.  This
accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of financing
current construction, and treats such financing costs in the same manner as
construction charges for labor and materials.

Under accepted rate-making practice, cash recovery of AFC, as well as other
construction costs, occurs when completed projects are placed in service and
reflected in customer rates.

AFC rates are established by the Company consistent with the methodology
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Average annual AFC
rates were 8.9% in 1994, 7.8% in 1993, and 6.2% in 1992.

CALLAWAY RATE PHASE-IN PLANS
The Callaway rate phase-in plans effective in 1985 as a result of regulatory
commission orders provided for the partial deferral of a cash recovery of costs
related to the Callaway Plant during the early years of the plans with recovery
of such deferrals in the later years of the plans.

A 1987 order of the Missouri Public Service Commission provided that $159
million of deferred costs at December 31, 1987, applicable to Missouri be
recovered in rates over the five years 1988 through 1992.

REVENUES
The Company accrues on its books estimated, but unbilled, revenue.

Operating Revenues include excise taxes of $97.9 million, $97.8 million and
$93.0 million for the years 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 2 - DEBT RETIREMENT PROVISIONS
During the five years from December 31, 1994, the amounts of debt maturities
totaling $248 million are: $68 million in 1995; $35 million in 1996; $45
million in 1997, and $100 million in 1999.  Amounts for years subsequent to
1995 do not include nuclear fuel lease payments since the amounts of such
payments are not currently determinable.

Debt retirement provisions contained in some mortgage bond indentures of the
Company require, subject to certain alternatives, the redemption annually of 1%
of the principal amount (as defined) of each series of bonds. In substantially
all instances, as permitted by the indentures, the Company has been pledging
property additions in lieu of such redemptions.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY

NOTE 3 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
Short-term borrowings of the Company consist of bank loans (maturities
generally on an overnight basis) and commercial paper (maturities generally
within 10-45 days). At December 31, 1994, no such borrowings were outstanding.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding for each of the
periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 was 3.3%.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had committed bank lines of credit
aggregating $184 million (all of which were unused) which make available
interim financing at various rates of interest based on LIBOR, the bank
certificate of deposit rate, or other options, and in support of which the
Company has agreements with its lending banks to pay annual fees up to 0.125%.
These lines of credit are renewable annually at various dates throughout the
year.

NOTE 4 - NUCLEAR FUEL LEASE
The Company has a lease agreement which provides for the financing of nuclear
fuel.  Effective February 1, 1994, the maximum amount which may be financed
under the agreement was increased from $100 million to $120 million. Pursuant
to the terms of the lease, the Company has assigned to the lessor certain
contracts for purchase of nuclear fuel. The lessor obtains, through the
issuance of commercial paper or from direct loans under a committed revolving
credit agreement from commercial banks, the necessary funds to purchase the
fuel and make interest payments when due.

The Company is obligated to reimburse the lessor for all expenditures for
nuclear fuel, interest, and related costs. Obligations under this lease become
due as the nuclear fuel is consumed at the Company's Callaway nuclear plant.
The Company reimbursed the lessor $34.5 million during 1994, $55.0 million
during 1993, and $54.3 million during 1992.

The Company has capitalized the cost, including certain interest costs, of
the leased nuclear fuel and has recorded the related lease obligation.  During
the years 1994, 1993, and 1992, the total interest charges under the lease were
$5.2 million, $3.1 million, and $4.4 million (based on average interest rates
of 4.7%, 3.6%, and 4.3%, respectively) of which $2.7 million, $1.4 million, and
$1.3 million, respectively, were capitalized.

NOTE 5 - PREFERRED STOCK
During the three years ended December 31, 1994, preferred stock, without par
value, was issued or redeemed as follows: issued 1,657,500 shares, $1.735
Series and 330,000 shares, $7.64 Series in 1993; redeemed 350,000 shares, $8.00
Series and 425,000 shares, $8.00 Series of 1971 in 1993.  The Company retired
260 shares, $6.30 Series in 1994, 1993, and 1992.

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES
Total income tax expense for 1994 resulted in an effective tax rate of 39% on
earnings before income taxes (38% in 1993 and 39% in 1992). The principal
reasons such rates differ from the statutory Federal rate are as follows:

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  Prior to 1993, in accordance with accepted ratemaking practice,
deferred income taxes were not provided for certain temporary differences
flowed through to customers and the equity component of Allowance for Funds
Used During Construction.  SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of the income tax
effect of such temporary differences.  Accordingly, a Regulatory Asset,
representing the probable recovery from customers of future income taxes which
is expected to occur when the temporary differences reverse, has been recorded
along with a corresponding deferred tax liability.  Also, a Regulatory
Liability recognizing the lower expected revenue resulting from reduced income
taxes associated with amortizing accumulated deferred investment tax credits,
has been recorded.  The deferred tax asset corresponding to this Regulatory
Liability has been combined with the deferred tax liabilities.

SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax liabilities be adjusted for enacted
changes in tax laws or rates.  Accordingly, the Company reduced its deferred
tax liabilities for amounts previously recorded in excess of the current
statutory rate.  Recognizing that regulators will probably reduce future
revenues for these excess tax deferrals, the reduction in the deferred tax
liability was credited to the Regulatory Liability.

Adopting SFAS No. 109 increased both assets and liabilities at December 31,
1994 and 1993, by approximately $732 million and $762 million, respectively,
but did not affect the Company's earnings on common stock in these years.

Under SFAS No. 109, temporary differences gave rise to deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities at year-end 1994 and 1993 as follows (in millions):

NOTE 8 - RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company has non-contributory, defined-benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all of its employees. Benefits are based on the employees' years
of service and compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute
annually at least the minimum amount required by government funding standards,
but not more than can be deducted for Federal income taxes. Plan assets consist
principally of common stocks and fixed income securities.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.  Substantially all of
the Company's employees may become eligible for those benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for the Company.  Prior to 1993, the costs of
retiree health care and life insurance benefits were recognized on the basis of
claims paid.  For 1994, 1993, and 1992, the actual claims paid were $15.6
million, $14.6 million, and $13.5 million, respectively.

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than
Pensions," which requires accrual of expected postretirement benefit costs
during employees' years of service.  Postretirement benefit costs for the years
1994 and 1993 were $46 million and $53 million, respectively, of which
approximately 18% was charged to construction accounts in each of the years.
The Company's transition obligation at December 31, 1994 is being amortized
over the next 18 years.

A one percent increase in the medical cost trend rate is estimated to increase
the net periodic cost and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $3 million and $22 million, respectively.

Adopting SFAS 106 reduced the Company's earnings on common stock by $14 million
or 14 cents per share in 1994 and $20 million or 20 cents per share in 1993.

(a)   Retrospective premium under the Price-Anderson liability provisions of
      the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (Price-Anderson).  Subject to
      retrospective assessment with respect to loss from an incident at any U.S.
      reactor, payable at $10 million per year.
(b)   Limit of liability for each incident under Price-Anderson.
(c)   Total industry potential liability from workers claiming exposure to the
      hazard of nuclear radiation.  The policy includes an automatic 
      reinstatement thereby providing total coverage of $400 million.
(d)   Includes up to $250 million for premature decommissioning costs in excess
      of costs previously collected.
(e)   Weekly indemnity of $3.1 million, for 52 weeks which commences after the
      first 21 weeks of an outage, plus $2.5 million per week for 104 weeks
      thereafter.

Price-Anderson limits the liability for claims from an incident involving any
licensed U.S. nuclear facility.  Such limit is based on the number of licensed
reactors and is adjusted at least every five years based on the Consumer Price
Index.  Utilities owning a nuclear reactor cover this exposure through a
combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial
protection pool as established by Price-Anderson.

If losses from a nuclear incident at Callaway Plant exceed the limits of, or
are not subject to, insurance, or if coverage is not available, the Company
will self-insure the risk.  Although the Company has no reason to anticipate a
serious nuclear incident, if one did occur it could have a material but
undeterminable adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to reduce
total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide significantly by the year 2000.
Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  With switching
to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company
anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
significant revenue increases because the related capital costs, estimated at
about $300 million, are largely offset by lower fuel costs.  At year-end 1994
about 65 percent of the Clean Air Act related capital costs had been expended.

As of December 31, 1994, the Company was designated a potentially responsible
party (PRP) by federal and state environmental protection agencies at five
hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been identified for
which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated a PRP.  The
Company continually reviews the remediation costs that will be required for
these sites.  However, such costs are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position.

The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various
courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of
business, some of which involve substantial amounts. The Company believes that
the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial position.  In November 1992, the Missouri Public
Service Commission (MoPSC) approved a settlement among various parties
involving the Company's Missouri electric rates.  Under the terms of the
settlement, rate decreases for all classes of Missouri electric customers
reduced 1993 annual revenues by approximately $42 million.

See Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Liquidity and Capital Resources for
information regarding the Company's acquisition and sales of electric
properties.

NOTE 11 - CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
DOE currently charges one mill per kilowatthour sold for future disposal of
spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide for recovery of such
costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage facility for spent
fuel available until at least 2010.  The Company has sufficient storage
capacity at the Callaway Plant site until 2005 and has viable storage
alternatives under consideration.  Each alternative will likely require Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approval and may require other regulatory approvals.  The
delayed availability of DOE's disposal facility is not expected to adversely
affect the continued operation of the Callaway Plant.

The Balance Sheet at December 31, 1994, includes a $21 million liability and a
corresponding asset representing a special DOE assessment on all utilities
owning nuclear plants.  The assessment is for the future decontamination,
decommissioning and reclamation of DOE uranium enrichment facilities.  It will
be paid and charged to expense and recovered in rates over the next 14 years.

The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned certain
accounting practices of the electric utility industry, regarding the
recognition, measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for
nuclear generating stations.  In response to these questions, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board is reviewing the accounting for removal costs,
including nuclear decommissioning.

Electric rates charged to customers provide for recovery of Callaway Plant
decommissioning costs over the life of the plant, based on an assumed 40-year
life, ending with expiration of the plant's operating license in 2024.  The
Callaway site is assumed to be decommissioned using the DECON (immediate
dismantlement) method.  Decommissioning costs, including decontamination,
dismantling and site restoration, are estimated to be $383 million in current
year dollars and are expected to escalate 4.5% per year through the end of
decommissioning activity in 2033.  Decommissioning costs are charged to
depreciation expense over Callaway's service life and amounted to $6.7 million
in each of the years 1994 and 1993, and $1.7 million in 1992.  Every three
years, the MoPSC requires the Company to file updated cost studies for
decommissioning Callaway and electric rates may be adjusted at such times to
reflect changes in assumptions.  Costs collected from customers are deposited
in an external trust fund established to provide for Callaway's
decommissioning.  Fund earnings are expected to average 10.4% through 2017 and
8.4% thereafter.  If the assumed return on trust assets is not earned, the
Company believes it is probable that such earnings deficiency will be recovered
in rates.  Trust fund earnings, net of expenses appear on the balance sheet as
increases in Nuclear decommissioning trust fund and in the Accumulated
provision for nuclear decommissioning.

This report and the financial statements contained herein are submitted for the
information of the stockholders of the Company and are not intended to induce,
or for use in connection with, any sale or purchase of any securities of the
Company.
