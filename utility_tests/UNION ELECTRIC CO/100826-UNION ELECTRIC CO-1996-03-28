ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

                                    GENERAL

        The registrant, Union Electric Company (the ""Company"), incorporated
in Missouri in 1922, is successor to a number of companies, the oldest of which
was organized in 1881. The Company, which is the largest electric utility in
the State of Missouri, supplies electric service in territories in Missouri and
Illinois having an estimated population of 2,600,000 within an area of 
approximately 24,500 square miles, including the greater St. Louis area.  
Retail gas service is supplied in 90 Missouri communities and in the City of 
Alton, Illinois and vicinity.

     On August 11, 1995, the Company and CIPSCO Incorporated ("CIPSCO") entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was subsequently approved by the
shareholders of both companies.  The merger ("Merger") is further conditioned
on, among other things, receipt of certain regulatory and governmental
approvals and is expected to be consummated in early 1997.  Upon completion of
the Merger, two operating companies will continue as subsidiaries of a newly
formed holding company, Ameren Corporation.  For additional information on the
Merger, see Note 2 to the "Notes to Financial Statements" on Page 29 of the
1995 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference and Item 4 below.
Also, see Item 14 below for unaudited pro forma financial information for
Ameren Corporation.

     For the year 1995, 95.8% of total operating revenues was derived from the
sale of electric energy and 4.2% from the sale of natural gas.  Electric
operating revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues for the years
1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994 were 95.7%, 95.7%, 95.2%, and 95.8% respectively.

     The Company employed 6,190 persons at December 31, 1995.  Approximately
70% of the Company's employees are represented by local unions affiliated with
the AFL-CIO.  Labor agreements representing approximately 4,282 employees will
expire in 1996.  Two agreements covering 118 employees will expire in 1997.


                       CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND FINANCING

     The Company is engaged in a construction program under which expenditures
averaging approximately $290 million are anticipated during each of the next
five years.  Capital expenditures for compliance with the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 are included in the construction program -- also see
"Regulation", below.  The Company does not anticipate a need for additional
base load electric generating capacity until after the year 2013.

     During the five-year period ended 1995, gross additions to the property of
the Company, including allowance for funds used during construction and
excluding nuclear fuel, were approximately $1.4 billion (including $311 million
in 1995) and property retirements were $215 million.

     In addition to the funds required for construction during the 1996-2000
period, $214 million will be required to repay long-term debt and preferred
stock as follows:  $69 million in 1996, $45 million in 1997, and $100 million
in 1999.  Amounts for years subsequent to 1996 do 


                                    - 1 -
<PAGE>   4

not include nuclear fuel lease payments since the amounts of such
payments are not currently determinable.

     For information on the Company's external cash sources, see "Liquidity and
Capital Resources" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on Page 20 of
the 1995 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference.

     FINANCING RESTRICTIONS.  Under the most restrictive earnings test
contained in the Company's principal Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust
("Mortgage") relating to its First Mortgage Bonds ("Bonds"), no Bonds may be
issued (except in certain refunding operations) unless the Company's net
earnings available for interest after depreciation for 12 consecutive months
within the 15 months preceding such issuance are at least two times annual
interest charges on all Bonds and prior lien bonds then outstanding and to be
issued (all calculated as provided in the Mortgage).  Such ratio for the 12
months ended December 31, 1995 was 6.6, which would permit the Company to issue
an additional $3.3 billion of Bonds (7% annual interest rate assumed).
Additionally, the Mortgage permits issuance of new bonds up to (a) 60% of
defined property additions, or (b) the amount of previous bonds retired or to
be retired, or (c) the amount of cash put up for such purpose.  At December 31,
1995, the aggregate amount of Bonds issuable under (a) and (b) above was
approximately $1.7 billion.  The Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation
restrict the Company from selling Preferred Stock unless its net earnings for a
period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding such sale are at
least two and one-half times the annual dividend requirements on its Preferred
Stock then outstanding and to be issued.  Such ratio for the 12 months ended
December 31, 1995 was 23.3, which would permit the Company to issue an
additional $1.6 billion stated value of Preferred Stock (7% annual dividend
rate assumed).  Certain other financing arrangements require the Company to
obtain prior consents to various actions by the Company, including any future
borrowings, except for permitted financings such as borrowings under revolving
credit agreements, the nuclear fuel lease, unsecured short-term borrowings
(subject to certain conditions), and the issuance of additional Bonds.


                                     RATES

     For the year 1995, approximately 89%, 8%, and 3% of the Company's electric
operating revenues were based on rates regulated by Missouri Public Service
Commission ("Missouri Commission"), Illinois Commerce Commission ("Illinois
Commission"), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") of the 
U.S. Department of Energy, respectively.

     For additional information on "Rates", see Note 3 to the "Notes to
Financial Statements" on Page 30 of the 1995 Annual Report pages incorporated
herein by reference.

     COAL.  Because of uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages,
equipment breakdowns and other factors, the Company has a policy of maintaining
a coal inventory of 75 days, based on normal annual burn practices.  See
"Regulation" for additional reference to the Company's coal requirements.

     NUCLEAR.  The components of the nuclear fuel cycle required for nuclear
generating units are as follows:  (1) uranium; (2) conversion of uranium into
uranium hexafluoride; (3) enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; (4) conversion of
enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide and the fabrication into
nuclear fuel assemblies; and (5) disposal and/or reprocessing of spent nuclear
fuel.

     The Company has agreements to fulfill its needs for uranium, enrichment,
and fabrication services through 2001.  The Company's agreements for conversion
services are sufficient to supply the Callaway Plant through 1997.  Additional
contracts will have to be entered into in order to supply nuclear fuel during
the remainder of the life of the Plant, at prices which cannot now be
accurately predicted.  The Callaway Plant normally requires re-fueling at
18-month intervals and re-fuelings are presently scheduled for the fall of 1996
and the spring of 1998.

     Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U. S. Department of Energy
("DOE") is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear
fuel.  DOE currently charges one mill per nuclear generated kilowatt-hour sold
for future disposal of spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide
for recovery of such costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage
facility for spent fuel available until at least 2015.  The Company has
sufficient storage capacity at the Callaway Plant site until 2005 and has
viable storage alternatives under consideration.  Each alternative will likely
require Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval and may require other regulatory
approvals. The delayed availability of DOE's disposal facility is not expected
to adversely affect the continued operation of the Callaway Plant.

     OIL AND GAS.  The actual and prospective use of such fuels is minimal, and
the Company has not experienced and does not expect to experience difficulty in
obtaining adequate supplies.

     For additional information on the Company's "Fuel Supply", see Note 12 to
the "Notes to Financial Statements" on Page 34 of the 1995 Annual Report pages
incorporated herein by reference.

                                   REGULATION

     The Company is subject to regulation by the Missouri Commission and the
Illinois Commission as to rates, service, accounts, issuance of equity
securities, issuance of debt having a maturity of more than twelve months,
mergers, and various other matters.  The Company is also subject to regulation
by the FERC as to rates and charges in connection with the transmission of
electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale
in interstate commerce, mergers, and certain other matters.  Authorization to
issue debt having a maturity of twelve months or less is obtained from the
FERC.

     Operation of the Company's Callaway Plant is subject to regulation by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The Company's Facility Operating License for
the Callaway Plant expires on October 18, 2024.

     The Company's Osage hydroelectric plant and its Taum Sauk pumped-storage
hydro plant, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to
certain federal regulations 

                                    - 3 -
<PAGE>   6

affecting, among other things, the general operation and maintenance of the
projects.  The Company's license for the Osage Plant expires on February 28,
2006, and its license for the Taum Sauk Plant expires on June 30, 2010.  The
Company's Keokuk Plant and dam located in the Mississippi River between
Hamilton, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority, unlimited in
time, granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

     The Company is exempt from the provisions of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 ("PUHCA"), except Section 9(a)(2) relating to the
acquisition of securities of other public utility companies and Section
11(b)(2) with respect to concluding matters relating to the 1974 acquisition of
the common stock of a former subsidiary.  When the Securities and Exchange
Commission approved such acquisition it reserved jurisdiction to pass upon the
right of the Company to retain its gas properties.  For information on PUHCA
and the Merger, see Note 2 to the "Notes to Financial Statements" on Page 29 of
the 1995 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company is regulated, in certain of its operations, by air and water
pollution and hazardous waste regulations at the city, county, state and
federal levels.  The Company is in substantial compliance with such existing
regulations.

     Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to
reduce total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by the year 2000.  Significant
reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  With switching to
low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company anticipates
that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no significant revenue
increases because the related capital costs, estimated at about $300 million,
are largely offset by lower fuel costs.  As of the end of 1995 about 75% of the
Clean Air Act related capital costs had been expended.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company was designated a potentially
responsible party ("PRP") by federal or state environmental protection agencies
for five hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been
identified for which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated
a PRP.  The Company continually reviews remedial costs that will be required
for all of these sites.  However, such costs are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

     Other aspects of the Company's business are subject to the jurisdiction of
various regulatory authorities.

                                INDUSTRY ISSUES

     The Company is facing issues common to the electric and gas utility
industries which have emerged during the past several years.  These issues
include:  the potential for more intense competition and for changing the
structure of utility regulation; changes in the structure of the industry as a
result of amendments to federal laws regulating ownership of generating
facilities and access to transmission systems; continually developing
environmental laws, regulations and issues; public concern about the siting of
new facilities; increasing public attention on the potential public health
consequences of exposure to electric and magnetic fields emanating from power
lines and other electric sources; proposals for demand side management
programs; and public concerns about nuclear decommissioning and the disposal of
nuclear wastes, and about global climate issues.  The Company is monitoring
these issues and is unable to predict at this time what impact, if any, these
issues will have on its operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

     In planning its construction program, the Company is presently
utilizing a forecast of kilowatthour sales growth of approximately 1.8% and
peak load growth of 1%, each compounded annually, and is providing for a
minimum reserve margin of approximately 18% to 22% above its anticipated peak
load requirements.

     See "Operating Statistics", incorporated by reference in Part I of this
Form 10-K, for information on loads and capability during the five-year period
ended 1995.

     The Company is a member of one of the nine regional electric reliability
councils organized for coordinating the planning and operation of the nation's
bulk power supply - MAIN (Mid-America Interconnected Network) operating
primarily in Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri. The Company has interconnections
for the exchange of power, directly and through the facilities of others,
within thirteen private utilities and with Associated Electric Cooperative,
Inc., the City of Columbia, Missouri, the Southwestern Power Administration and
the Tennessee Valley Authority.

     The Company owns 40% of the capital stock of Electric Energy, Inc.
("EEI"), the balance of which is held by three other sponsoring companies --
Kentucky Utilities Company ("KU"), Central Illinois Public Service Company
("CIPS" -- a subsidiary of CIPSCO), and Illinois Power Company ("IP"). EEI owns
and operates a generating plant with a nominal capacity of 1,000 mW.

                                    - 6 -

<PAGE>   9
60% of the plant's output is committed to the Paducah Project of the DOE, 20%
is committed to KU, 10% to the Company, and 5% each to IP and CIPS.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company owned approximately 3,299 circuit
miles of electric transmission lines and substations with a transformer
capacity of approximately 44,989,000 kVA. The Company owns four propane-air
plants with an aggregate daily natural gas equivalent capacity of 31,590
million cubic feet and 2,629 miles of gas mains. Other properties of the
Company include distribution lines, underground cable, steam distribution
facilities in Jefferson City, Missouri and office buildings, warehouses,
garages and repair shops.

     The Company has fee title to all principal plants and other important
units of property, or to the real property on which such facilities are located
(subject to mortgage liens securing outstanding indebtedness of the Company and
to permitted liens and judgment liens, as defined), except that (i) a portion
of the Osage Plant reservoir, certain facilities at the Sioux Plant, certain of
the Company's substations and most of its transmission and distribution lines
and gas mains are situated on lands occupied under leases, easements,
franchises, licenses or permits; (ii) the United States and/or the State of
Missouri own, or have or may have, paramount rights to certain lands lying in
the bed of the Osage River or located between the inner and outer harbor lines
of the Mississippi River, on which certain generating and other properties of
the Company are located; and (iii) the United States and/or State of Illinois
and/or State of Iowa and/or City of Keokuk, Iowa own, or have or may have,
paramount rights with respect to, certain lands lying in the bed of the
Mississippi River on which a portion of the Company's Keokuk Plant is located.

     Substantially all of the Company's property and plant is subject to the
direct first lien of an Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated June 15,
1937, as amended and supplemented. As part of the 1983 merger of the Company
with its utility subsidiaries, the Company assumed the mortgage indenture of
each subsidiary. Currently, the prior liens of two former subsidiary indentures
extend to the property and franchises acquired by the Company from such
subsidiaries. Such indentures also contain provisions subjecting to the prior
lien thereof after-acquired property of the Company constituting (with certain
exceptions) additions, extensions, improvements, repairs, and replacements
appurtenant to property acquired in the merger. In addition, one such indenture
contains a provision subjecting to the prior lien thereof after-acquired
property of the Company situated in the territory served by the former
subsidiary prior to the merger. Further, no debt is outstanding under the one
such indenture, and the Company is in the process of extinguishing the lien of
such indenture.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary
course of business, some of which involve substantial amounts. Management is of
the opinion that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     A special meeting of the Company's shareholders was held on December 20,
1995 to vote on a proposal providing for the Merger with CIPSCO. Shareholders
approved the proposal and, as reported by the inspectors of election, shares
were voted as follows: For - 75,091,584; Against - 1,972,890; Abstain -
1,027,681; broker non-votes - 167,549.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

AMEREN CORPORATION

        The following unaudited pro forma financial information combines the
historical balance sheets and statements of income of the Company and CIPSCO,
including their respective subsidiaries, after giving effect to the Merger. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at December 31, 1995 gives
effect to the Merger as if it had occurred at December 31, 1995. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed statements of income for each of the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, give effect to the Merger as if it had
occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. These statements are
prepared on the basis of accounting for the Merger as a pooling of interests
and are based on the assumptions set forth in the notes thereto. In addition,
the pro forma financial information does not give effect to the expected
synergies of the transaction.

        The following pro forma financial information has been prepared from,
and should be read in conjunction with, the historical financial statements and
related notes thereto of the Company and CIPSCO. The following information is
not necessarily indicative of the financial position or operating results that
would have occurred had the Merger been consummated on the date, or at the
beginning of the periods, for which the Merger is being given effect nor is it
necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.

                              AMEREN CORPORATION


NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Reclassifications have been made to certain "as reported" account
     balances reflected in the Company's and CIPSCO's financial statements to
     conform to this reporting presentation (See Notes 6, 7 and 8).  All other
     financial statement presentation and accounting policy differences are
     immaterial and have not been adjusted in the pro forma combined condensed
     financial statements.

2.   The pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect the
     conversion of each share of the Company's Common Stock ($5 par value)
     outstanding into one share of Ameren Common Stock ($.01 par value) and the
     conversion of each share of CIPSCO Common Stock (no par value) outstanding
     into 1.03 shares of Ameren Common Stock, as provided in the Merger
     Agreement.  The pro forma combined condensed financial statements are
     presented as if the companies were combined during all periods included
     therein.

3.   Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 includes
     CIPSCO's pre-tax charges of $5.8 million for a voluntary separation
     program and $5.7 million of system development expenses.

4.   The allocation between the Company and CIPSCO and their customers of the
     estimated cost savings resulting from the Merger, net of the costs
     incurred to achieve such savings, will be subject to regulatory review and
     approval.  Transaction costs are currently estimated to be approximately
     $22 million (including fees for financial advisors, attorneys,
     accountants, consultants, filings and printing).  None of these estimated
     cost savings or the costs to achieve such savings have been reflected in
     the pro forma combined condensed financial statements.  However, net
     income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 includes Merger
     transaction charges of $9.0 million, net of income taxes, for the Company
     and $4.7 million, net of income taxes, for CIPSCO.

5.   Intercompany transactions (including purchased and exchanged power
     transactions) between the Company and CIPSCO during the periods presented
     were not material and, accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were made to
     eliminate such transactions.

6.   CIPSCO's regulatory asset related to deferred income taxes was
     reclassified from the regulatory liability account balance to conform to
     this reporting presentation.

7.   CIPSCO's income taxes are reflected as operating expenses to conform to
     this reporting presentation.

8.   Currently, the Company's Preferred Stock is not issued by a subsidiary;
     subsequent to the Merger, the Company's Preferred Stock will be issued by
     a subsidiary of Ameren.  As a result, the Company's preferred dividend
     requirements have been reclassified to conform to this reporting
     presentation.

9.   Pro forma adjustments have been made to consolidate the financial results
     of Electric Energy, Inc. (EEI), which will, in substance, be a 60% owned
     subsidiary of Ameren subsequent to the Merger.  The Company and CIPSCO
     hold 40% and 20% ownership interests, respectively, in EEI and account for
     these investments under the equity method of accounting.  All
     intercompany transactions between the Company, CIPSCO and EEI have been
     eliminated.

10.  Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 includes a
     one-time credit to Missouri electric customers which reduced revenues and
     pre-tax income of the registrant by $30 million.

        SECTION 1.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this Long Term Incentive Plan of 
1995 (the "Plan") of Union Electric Company (together with any successor 
thereto, the "Company") is (1) to increase incentive to enhance the value of 
the Company for the benefit of its customers and shareholders; (2) to 
encourage management to further develop an interest in the long-term growth 
and performance of the Company; and (3) to aid in the attraction and retention 
of qualified personnel.

        SECTION 2.  DEFINITIONS.  In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in
the Plan, the following shall be defined terms under the Plan:

        "Award" means any Performance Award, Option, Stock Appreciation Right,
Restricted Stock, Dividend Equivalent, or Other Stock-Based Award, or any other

instrument or document evidencing an Award.

        "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

        "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to
time, including successor provisions thereto and regulations thereunder.

        "Committee" means the Human Resources Committee of the Board, or such
other Board committee as may be designated by the Board to administer the
Plan, or any subcommittee of either; provided, however, that the Committee
shall be constituted to permit the Plan to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

        "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
from time to time, including successor provisions thereto and regulations 
thereunder.

        "Fair Market Value" means, with respect to Shares, Awards, or other
property, the fair market value of such Shares, Awards, or other property
determined by such methods or procedures as shall be established from time to
time by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Fair
Market Value of Shares as of any date shall be the closing sale price
on that date of a Share as reported in the New York Stock Exchange Composite

which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock. In addition, any other related

        In addition to the foregoing, the terms "Performance Award", "Option",
"Stock Appreciation Right", "Restricted Stock", "Dividend Equivalent" and

SECTION 3.  ADMINISTRATION.

        3.01.  Authority of the Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the
Committee on behalf of the Board. The Committee shall have full power to
interpret the Plan, to establish, modify and grant waivers of Award
restrictions and to adopt such rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying
out the Plan as it deems necessary or appropriate. All determinations by the
Committee shall be final and binding upon all parties affected thereby.

        3.02.  Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority. The express grant of
any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the
Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the
Committee. A memorandum signed by all members of the Committee shall constitute
the act of the Committee without the necessity, in such event, to hold a
meeting. The Committee may delegate to officers or managers of the Company or
any Subsidiary the authority, subject to such terms as the Committee shall
determine, to perform administrative functions under the Plan. Only the
Committee may select, and grant Awards to, Participants who are subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

<PAGE>   3
        SECTION 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.  Subject to adjustment as
provided in the Plan, the total number of Shares that may be issued or
delivered pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be 2,500,000, which shall
consist of Shares which have been authorized and issued and have been acquired
by or on behalf of the Company or the Plan and are available for Awards under
the Plan; provided that, if the Board shall hereafter so authorize, such Shares
may consist of authorized and unissued Shares. Subject to the requirements of
Rule 16b-3, the Committee may adopt procedures for the counting of Shares
relating to any Award for which the number of Shares to be distributed or with
respect to which payment will be made cannot be fixed at the date of grant to
ensure appropriate counting, avoid double counting (in the case of tandem or
substitute awards), and provide for adjustments in any case in which the number
of Shares actually distributed or with respect to which payments are actually
made differs from the number of Shares previously counted in connection with
such Award. To the extent permitted under Rule 16b-3, in the event that any
Shares to which an Award relates are forfeited or the Award is settled or
terminates without a distribution of Shares (whether or not cash, other
Awards, or other property is distributed with respect to such Award), any
Shares counted against the number of Shares reserved and available under the
Plan with respect to such Award shall again be available for Awards under the 
Plan.

        SECTION 5. ELIGIBILITY.  Awards may be granted only to individuals who
are officers or other employees (including employees who also are directors)
of the Company or a Subsidiary; provided, however, that no Award shall be
granted to any member of the Committee.

        SECTION 6. SPECIFIC TERMS OF AWARDS

        6.01.   General.  The Committee may grant Awards as described in this
Section. The Committee shall determine who may participate in the Plan and the
number and types of Awards to be made to each Participant and shall determine
and set forth in the Award or the related Award Agreement the terms, 
conditions, performance requirements (if any) and limitations (which need not
be limited to those referred to below) applicable to each Award. Awards may be
granted singly, in combination or in tandem.

        6.02.   Performance Awards.   A Performance Award shall confer upon
the Participant a right to receive cash, Shares, other Awards, or the property
contingent upon the achievement of performance goals specified by the
Committee. A Performance Award shall be denominated in Shares and may be
payable in cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property, and have such other
terms as shall be determined by the Committee.

        6.03.   Restricted Stock.   Restricted Stock shall confer upon the
Participant the right to receive Shares subject to such restrictions on
transferability and other restrictions as the Committee may impose (including,
without limitation, forfeiture if such restrictions are not satisfied,
limitations on the right to vote and limitations on the right to receive
dividends), which restrictions may lapse at such times and under such
circumstances as the Committee shall determine.

                                    - 3 -
<PAGE>   4
        6.04.  Options.  An Option shall confer upon the Participant the right
to purchase Shares, other Awards, or property, subject to the following terms
and conditions:

               (i)  Exercise Price.  The exercise price per Share purchasable
under an Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the
date of grant of such Option.

               (ii)  Time and Method of Exercise.  The Committee shall
determine the time during which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part,
the methods by which the exercise price may be paid and the methods by which
Shares will be delivered to Participants. Options shall expire not later than
ten years after the date of grant.

               (iii)  Terms Applicable to Incentive Stock Options.  The terms
of any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all
respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code which, among other
limitations, provides that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the
time the Option is granted) of Shares for which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year shall
not exceed $100,000. The number of Shares that shall be available for Incentive
Stock Options granted under the Plan is limited to 500,000. Anything in the
Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of the Plan relating to Incentive
Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended, or altered, nor shall any
discretion or authority granted under the Plan be exercised, so as to
disqualify either the Plan or any Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of
the Code.

               (iv)  Limitation on Re-Pricing and Replacement.  No Option shall
provide by its terms for the re-setting of its exercise price, or for its
replacement, in whole or in part, upon its exercise or expiration; provided
that the foregoing shall not limit the authority of the Committee to grant
additional Options in any such event or circumstance.

        6.05.  Stock Appreciation Rights.  A Stock Appreciation Right shall
confer upon the Participant a right to receive the excess of (A) the Fair
Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, except in the case of a
Stock Appreciation Right related to an Incentive Stock Option, the Fair Market
Value of one Share at any time during a specified period before or after the
date of exercise) over (B) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right,
which shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of
grant. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted as a Limited Stock
Appreciation Right which may be exercised only upon the occurrence of a Change
of Control. Stock Appreciation Rights shall expire not later than ten years
after the date of grant.

        6.06.  Dividend Equivalents.  A Dividend Equivalent shall confer upon
the Participant a right to receive cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property
equal in value to dividends paid with respect to a specified number of Shares.

        6.07.  Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant
to Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in
whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares,
as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan.


                                    - 4 -
<PAGE>   5

        SECTION 7.  CERTAIN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS.

        7.01.  Certain Performance-Based Awards.  The Committee may provide in
any Award Agreement that Performance Awards, including Restricted Stock and
other Awards which may be forfeited for non-satisfaction of performance
criteria, made to certain employees are intended to be "qualified
performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the
Code and shall be paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more
preestablished, objective performance goals within the meaning of Section
162(m). If any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement does not comply
with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code as then applicable to any
such employee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the
extent necessary to conform to such requirements with respect to such employee.

        7.02.  Term of Awards.  The term of each Award shall be for such period
as shall be determined by the Committee subject to the requirements of the
Plan.

        7.03.  Forms of Payment.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and any
applicable Award Agreement, (i) payments to be made by the Company or a
Subsidiary with respect to Awards may be made in such forms as the Committee
shall determine; and (ii) the timing, method, amount and nature of payments to
be made by Participants with respect to Awards (including, if permitted by the
Committee, by means of tendering Shares or Awards) shall be determined by the
Committee.

        7.04.  Termination of Employment.  If the employment of a Participant
terminates, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be cancelled
immediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise or unless the
Committee shall provide otherwise in connection with such termination,
including without limitation, in the case of termination pursuant to
retirement, resignation, death or disability of a Participant.

        7.05.  Minimum Holding Period.  Unless otherwise provided by the
Committee with respect to any Award, Awards payable, in whole or in part, in
Shares must be held for at least six months (i) in the case of an Option, Stock
Appreciation Right or Dividend Equivalent, from the date of grant to the date
of disposition exercise; and (ii) in the case of other Awards, from the date of
acquisition to the date of disposition.

        SECTION 8.  GENERAL RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS.

        8.01.  Restrictions Under Rule 16b-3.  It is the intent of the Company
that this Plan comply (including but not limited to holding period and
nontransferability limitations) in all respects with Rule 16b-3 in connection
with any Award granted to a person who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act. Accordingly, if any provision of this Plan of any Award Agreement does not
comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 as then applicable to any such
person, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent
necessary to conform to such requirements with respect to such person.

                                    - 5 -

<PAGE>   6
        8.02  Limits on Transfer of Awards; Beneficiaries.  No Award may be
assigned or transferred by a Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution, or payable to or exercisable by anyone other than the
Participant to whom it was granted, and no right or interest of a Participant
in any Award may be pledged, encumbered or hypothecated to or in favor of any
party, or shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of a
Participant to any party; provided, however, that (i) a Participant may, in the
manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries
to exercise the rights of the Participant, and to receive any distribution with
respect to any Award, upon the death or disability of the Participant, (ii) the
Committee may provide in any Award or the related Award Agreement that an Award
(other than an Incentive Stock Option) may be assigned, transferred,
exercisable by another person or pledged, encumbered or hypothecated, subject
to the applicable requirements of the Code and provided that such provision or
transfer would not cause the Plan not to be in compliance with the requirements
of Rule 16b-3 and (iii) transfers of Awards may be made to the Company or a
Subsidiary to the extent permitted under the terms of the Plan. A beneficiary,
guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights under the
Plan from or through any Participant shall be subject to all terms and
conditions of the Plan and any Award Agreement applicable to such Participant,
except to the extent the Plan and such Award Agreement otherwise
provide with respect to such persons, and to any additional restrictions deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

        8.03  Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares delivered under
the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such
stop-transfer order and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable
under applicable federal or state laws, rules and regulations thereunder, and
the rules of any national securities exchange on which Shares are listed. The
Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates
to make appropriate reference to such restrictions or any other restrictions
that may be applicable to Shares. In addition, during any period in which
Awards or Shares are subject to restrictions, or during any period during which
delivery or receipt of an Award or Shares has been deferred by the Committee or
a Participant, the Committee may require the Participant to enter into an
agreement providing that certificates representing Shares issuable or issued
pursuant to an Award shall remain in the physical custody of the Company or
such other person as the Committee may designate.

        If certificates representing Restricted Stock are registered in the
name of the Participant, such certificates shall bear an appropriate legend
referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such
Restricted Stock, the Company shall retain physical possession of the
certificates, and the Participant shall deliver a stock power to the Company,
endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Stock.

        SECTION 9.  CHANGE OF CONTROL.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, the following acceleration provisions shall apply in the event of a
"Change of Control" as defined in this Section:

        9.01.  Acceleration.  In the event of a Change of Control, unless
otherwise provided in the related Award Agreement: (i) all Limited Stock
Appreciation Rights shall become exercisable


                                    - 6 -

<PAGE>   7

in full; (ii) all Options which have not been granted in tandem with Limited
Stock Appreciation Rights shall become exercisable in full; and (iii) all
restrictions (other than restrictions imposed by law) and conditions of all
Restricted Stock then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied subject to any
holding period limitations.

        9.02  Change of Control.  "Change of Control" means a change of control
of the Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to
Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item
of any similar schedule or form) under the Exchange Act, whether or not the
Company is then subject to such reporting requirements; provided, however,
that, without limitation, such a Change of Control shall be deemed to have
occurred if: (i) any person, other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding
securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, and other than the
Company or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of
the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock
of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
representing 20% or more of the Common Stock of the Company then outstanding;
or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the
beginning of such period constitute the Board and any new directors (other than
a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the
Company to effect a transaction described in (i) above) whose election by the
Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by
a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who
either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or
nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board.

        SECTION 10.  ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS.  In the event that the Committee
shall determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of
cash, Shares, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, or share exchange, or other similar corporate transaction or event,
affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be
appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of
Participants under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may
deem equitable, make any adjustments it deems appropriate.  In addition, the
Committee is authorized to make such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the
terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of
unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described
in the preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or the
financial statements of the Company of any Subsidiary, or in response to
changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles.

        SECTION 11.  CHANGES TO THE PLAN AND AWARDS.    

        11.01.  Changes to the Plan.  The Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue or terminate the Plan without the consent of shareholders or
Participants, except as is required by any federal or state law or regulation
or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Shares may be listed, or if
the Board in its discretion determines that obtaining such shareholder 
approval is



                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>   8

for any reason advisable; provided, however, that (i) without the consent of an
affected Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or
termination of the Plan may impair the rights of such Participant under any
Award theretofore granted to such Participant; and (ii) the Plan may not be
amended without the consent of the holders of a majority of the Shares then
outstanding to (a) increase the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued
under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 10), (b) decrease
the Option Price, (c) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for
participation in the Plan, (d) withdraw administration of the Plan from the
Committee or (e) extend the period during which Awards may be granted.

        11.02.  Changes to Awards.  The Committee may waive any conditions or
rights under, or amend, alter, accelerate, suspend, discontinue, or terminate,
any Award theretofore granted and any Award Agreement relating thereto;
provided, however, that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such
amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or termination of any Award
may impair the rights of such Participant under such Award.

        SECTION 12.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

        12.01.  No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or employee shall have any
claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants and employees.

        12.02.  No Shareholder Rights.  No Award shall confer on any
Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until
Shares are duly issued or transferred to the Participant in accordance with the
terms of the Award.

        12.03.  Dividends.  The recipient of any Award may, if so determined by
the Committee, be entitled to receive on a current or deferred basis, dividends
or Dividend Equivalents, with respect to the number of Shares covered by the 
Award.

        12.04.  Tax Withholding.  The Company or any Subsidiary is authorized
to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the
Plan, including from a distribution of Shares, or any payroll or other payment
to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due with respect
thereto, its exercise, or any payment thereunder, and to take such other action
as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable to enable the Company and
Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and
other tax liabilities relating to any Award. This authority shall include
authority to withhold or receive Shares or other property and to make cash
payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participant's tax obligations.

        12.05.  No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in the Plan or any
Award Agreement shall confer, and no grant of an Award shall be construed as
conferring, upon any employee any right to continue in the employ of the
Company or any Subsidiary or to interfere in any way with the right of the
Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employee's employment at any time or
increase or decrease the employee's compensation from the rate in existence at
the time of granting of an Award.


                                     - 8 -




<PAGE>   9
        12.06.  Unfunded Status of Awards.  The Plan is intended to constitute
an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. Nothing contained
in the Plan, any Award Agreement, or any Award shall give any such Participant
any rights that are greater than those of an unsecured general creditor of 
the Company.

        12.07.  Other Compensatory Arrangements.  The Company or any Subsidiary
shall be permitted to adopt other or additional compensation arrangements (which
may include arrangements which relate to Awards), and such arrangements may be
either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

        12.08.  Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or
delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine
whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu
of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto
shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

        12.09.  Governing Law.  The validity, construction, and effect of the
Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, any action taken pursuant
to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Missouri, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and
applicable federal law.

        SECTION 13.  The Plan, the granting and exercising of Awards thereunder
and the other obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be subject to all
applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals
by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Company, in
its discretion, may postpone the granting and exercising of Awards, the
issuance or delivery of Shares under any Award or any other action permitted
under the Plan to permit the Company, with reasonable diligence, to complete
any stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of such Shares or
other required action under any federal or state law, rule or regulation and
may require any participant to make such representations and furnish such
information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or
delivery of Shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
The Company shall not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to
recognize the exercise of any Award or to otherwise sell or issue Shares in
violation of any such laws, rules, or regulations; and any postponement of the
exercise or settlement of any Award under this provision shall not extend the
term of such Award, and neither the Company nor its directors or officers shall
have any obligation or liability to the Participant with respect to any Award
(or stock issuable thereunder) that shall lapse because of such postponement.

        SECTION 14.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The Plan shall become effective on April
25, 1995 provided that the Plan is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Shares present or represented and entitled to vote
at a meeting of the Company's shareholders on that date. The Plan shall
terminate ten years after its effective date, subject to earlier termination by
the Board pursuant to Section 11, after which no Awards may be made under the
Plan, but any such termination shall not affect Awards then outstanding or the
authority of the Committee to continue to administer the Plan.

                             UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY
                        CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN

                                  Introduction

        The Board of Directors of Union Electric Company recognizes that, as is
the case with many publicly held corporations, there exists the possibility of
a Change of Control of the Company. This possibility and the uncertainty it
creates may result in the loss or distraction of senior executives of the
Company, to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders.

        The Board considers the avoidance of such loss and distraction to be
essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders. The Board also believes that when a Change of Control is
perceived as imminent, or is occurring, the Board should be able to receive and
rely on disinterested service from senior executives regarding the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, without concern that senior
executives might be distracted or concerned by the personal uncertainties and
risks created by the perception of an imminent or occurring Change of Control.

        In addition, the Board believes that it is consistent with the
Company's employment practices and policies and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders to treat fairly its employees whose employment
terminates in connection with or following a Change of Control.

        Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be
taken to assure the Company of the continued employment and attention and
dedication to duty of its senior executives and to seek to ensure the
availability of their continued service, notwithstanding the possibility,
threat or occurrence of a Change of Control.

        Therefore, in order to fulfill the above purposes, the following plan
has been developed and is hereby adopted.


                                   ARTICLE I
                             ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN

As of the Effective Date, the Company hereby establishes a separation
compensation plan known as Union Electric Company Change of Control Severance
Plan, as set forth in this document.


                                   ARTICLE II
                                  DEFINITIONS

As used herein, the following words and phrases shall have the following
respective meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

        (a)  Annual Bonus Award.  The annual cash bonus that a Participant is
eligible to earn pursuant to the Company's Executive Incentive Plan, and/or any
successors thereto.


<PAGE>   2

     (b) Annual Salary.  The Participant's regular annual base salary
immediately prior to his or her termination of employment, including
compensation converted to other benefits under a flexible pay arrangement
maintained by the Company or deferred pursuant to a written plan or agreement
with the Company.

     (c) Board.  The Board of Directors of Union Electric Company.

     (d) Cause.  With respect to any Participant: (i)  the willful and
continued failure of the Participant to perform substantially the Participant's
duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written
demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant by the Board
or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the
manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the
Participant has not substantially performed the Participant's duties, or (ii)
the willful engaging by the Participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct
which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.  For purposes of
this definition, no act or failure to act on the part of the Participant shall
be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the
Participant in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Participant's
action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act or
failure to act based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted
by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a
senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the
Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by
the Participant in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.

     (e) Change of Control.  The occurrence of any of the following events:

     (i) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning
of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of
either (x) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the
"Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (y) the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided,
however, that for purposes of this subsection (i), the following acquisitions
shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the
Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition by any
employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company
or any corporation con- trolled by the Company or (D) any acquisition by any
corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (A), (B) and
(C) of paragraph (iii) below; or

     (ii) Individuals who, as of the date of this Plan, constitute the Board
(the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director
subsequent to the date of this Plan whose election, or nomination for election
by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to the

                                     - 2 -

other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or

each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or
substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding
Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination
beneficially own, directly or indirectly,  more than 80% of, respectively, the
then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the
then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such
Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a
result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the
Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to
such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and
Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (B) no Person
(excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any
employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation
resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common
stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the

existed immediately prior to the illness or injury) on a full time basis for
180 consecutive business days.

     (l) Effective Date.  The date specified in the resolution of the Board
adopting this Plan.

requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities immediately before the
Change of Control, or any other action by the Company which results in a
significant diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities,

not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after
receipt of notice thereof given by the Participant; (ii) any material reduction

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  ELIGIBILITY

     3.1 Participation.  Each of the individuals named on Schedule I hereto
shall be a Participant in the Plan.  Schedule I may be amended by the Human
Resources Committee of the Board from time to time to add individuals as
Participants.

     3.2 Duration of Participation.  A Participant shall only cease to be a
Participant in the Plan as a result of an amendment or termination of the Plan
complying with Article VI of the Plan, or when he ceases to be an Employee of
any Employer, unless, at the time he ceases to be an Employee, such Participant
is entitled to payment of a Separation Benefit as provided in the Plan or there
has been an event or occurrence that constitutes Good Reason that which would
enable the Participant to terminate his employment and receive a Separation
Benefit.  A Participant entitled to payment of a Separation Benefit or any
other amounts under the Plan shall remain a Participant in the Plan until the
full amount of the Separation Benefit and any other amounts payable under the
Plan have been paid to the Participant.


                                   ARTICLE IV
                              SEPARATION BENEFITS

     4.1 Terminations of Employment Which Give Rise to Separation Benefits
Under Plan.  A Participant shall be entitled to Separation Benefits as set
forth in Section 4.2 below if, at any time before the third anniversary of the
Date of the Change of Control, the Participant's Employment is terminated (i)
by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability or Retirement
or (ii) by the Participant within 90 days after the occurrence of Good Reason.

     4.2 Separation Benefits.

     (a) If a Participant's employment is terminated under circumstances
entitling him to Separation Benefits as provided in Section 4.1, the Company
shall pay such Participant, within ten days of the Date of Termination, a cash
lump sum as set forth in subsection (b) below and the continued benefits set
forth in subsection (c) below.  For purposes of determining the benefits set
forth in subsection (b) and (c), if the termination of the Participant's
employment is for Good Reason after there has been a reduction of the
Participants Annual Salary, opportunity to earn Annual Bonuses, or other
compensation or employee benefits, such reduction shall be ignored.

     (b) The cash lump sum referred to in Section 4.2(a) is the aggregate of
the following amounts:


                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>   6


     (i) the sum of (1) the Participant's Annual Salary through the Date of
Termination to the extent not theretofore paid,  (2) the product of (x) the
Highest Annual Bonus and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the such year through the Date of Termination, and the denominator
of which is 365, and (3) any accrued vacation pay, to the extent not
theretofore paid and in full satisfaction of the rights of the Participant
thereto;

     (ii) an amount equal to the product of (1) the Participant's Multiple
times (2) the sum of the Participant's (x) Annual Salary and (y) Highest Annual
Bonus; and

     (iii) an amount equal to the difference between (a) the actuarial
equivalent of the benefit under the Company's qualified defined benefit
retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") and any excess or supplemental
retirement plans in which the Participant participates (collectively, the
"SERP") which the Participant would receive if his or her employment continued
during the Separation Period, assuming that the Participant's compensation
during the Separation Period would have been equal to his or her compensation
as in effect immediately before the termination or, if higher, on the Effective
Date, and (b) the actuarial equivalent of the Participant's actual benefit
(paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the
Date of Termination.  The actuarial assumptions used for purposes of
determining actuarial equivalence shall be no less favorable to the Participant
than the most favorable of those in effect under the Retirement Plan and the
SERP on the Date of Termination and the Effective Date.

 (c) The continued benefits referred to above are as follows:

     (i) during the Separation Period, the Participant and his or her family
shall be provided with medical, dental and life insurance benefits as if the
Participant's employment had not been terminated; provided, however, that if
the Participant becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to
receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan,
the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to
those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of
eligibility.  For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of
commencement of benefits) of the Participant for retiree medical, dental and
life insurance benefits under the Company's plans, practices, programs and
policies, the Participant shall be considered to have remained employed during
the Separation Period and to have retired on the last day of such period; and

     (ii) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide the
Participant with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be
selected by the Participant in his or her sole discretion (but at a cost to the
Company of not more than $30,000);

To the extent any benefits described in this Section 4.2(c) cannot be provided
pursuant to the appropriate plan or program maintained for Employees, the
Employer shall provide such benefits outside such plan or program at no
additional cost (including without limitation tax cost) to the Participant.

     4.3 Other Benefits Payable.  The cash lump sum and continuing benefits
described in Section 4.2 above shall be payable in addition to, and not in lieu
of, all other accrued or vested or earned but deferred compensation, rights,
options or other benefits which may be owed to a Participant upon or 



                                    - 6 -
<PAGE>   7

following termination, including but not limited to accrued vacation or sick
pay, amounts or benefits payable under any bonus or other compensation plans,
stock option plan, stock ownership plan, stock purchase plan, life insurance
plan, health plan, disability plan or similar or successor plan, but excluding
any severance pay or pay in lieu of notice required to be paid to such
Participant under applicable law.


     4.4 Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

     (a) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding and except as
set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of any Participant (whether
paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
Plan or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 4.4)  (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise
tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are
incurred by the Participant with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Participant shall be entitled to
receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that
after payment by the Participant of all taxes (including any interest or
penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation,
any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto)
and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Participant retains an
amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
Payments.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 4.4(c), all determinations
required to be made under this Section 4.4, including whether and when a
Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the
assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by
Arthur Andersen or such other certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Participant (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within
15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Participant that there has
been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  In the
event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Participant
shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the
determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred
to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be paid by the Company to the Participant
within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination.  Any
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999
of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm
hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made
by the Company should have been made ("Under-payment"), consistent with the
calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event that the Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 4.4(c) and the Participant thereafter
is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Participant.


                                    - 7 -

<PAGE>   8


     (c) The Participant shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by
the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by
the Company of the Gross-Up Payment.  Such notification shall be given as soon
as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Participant is
informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The
Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day
period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such
shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to
such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Participant in writing prior
to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the
Participant shall:

         (i)   give the Company any information reasonably requested by the 
Company relating to such claim,

         (ii)  take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the
Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including,
without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim
by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

         (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to
contest such claim, and

         (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to
such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all
costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in
connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Participant
harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including
interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such
representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the
foregoing provisions of this Section 4.4(c), the Company shall control all
proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may
pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its
sole option, either direct the Participant to pay the tax claimed and sue for a
refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant
agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate
courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company
directs the Participant to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company
shall advance the amount of such payment to the Participant, on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on
an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or
penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further
provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment
of taxes for the taxable year of the Participant with respect to which such
contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such
contested amount.  Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be
limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable
hereunder and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the
case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority.

     (d) If, after the receipt by the Participant of an amount advanced by the
Company pursuant to Section 4.4(c), the Participant becomes entitled to receive
any refund with respect to such claim, 

                                    - 8 -

<PAGE>   9

the Participant shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements
of Section 4.4(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund
(together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable
thereto).  If, after the receipt by the Participant of an amount advanced by the
Company pursuant to Section 4.4(c), a determination is made that the Participant
shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company
does not notify the Participant in writing of its intent to contest such
denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination,
then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and
the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of
Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

     4.5 Payment Obligations Absolute.

     The obligations of the Company and the Employers to pay the separation
benefits described in Section 4.2 and any additional payments described in
Section 4.4 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may have against any Participant.  In no event shall a Participant be obligated
to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the
amounts payable to a Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan, nor
shall the amount of any payment hereunder be reduced by any compensation earned
by a Participant as a result of employment by another employer, except as
specifically provided in Section 4.2(c)(i).

     4.6 Deferred Compensation Plan.  With respect to each Participant who is a
participant in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the
General Executive Staff, or any successor thereto (collectively, the "Deferred
Compensation Plan"), the definition of "Change of Control" for purposes of the
Deferred Compensation Plan shall be deemed to be the definition given in
Article II of this Plan, rather than the definition given in the Deferred
Compensation Plan.


                                   ARTICLE V
                              SUCCESSOR TO COMPANY

     This Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its
businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be
obligated under this Plan if no succession had taken place.

     In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the 
foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company
shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and
agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Plan, in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place.  The term "Company," as used in this Plan, shall
mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to the
business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Plan.

                      DURATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     6.1 Duration.  If a Change of Control has not occurred, this Plan shall
continue in effect until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, and shall
automatically be extended for successive two-year terms unless, not less than
one year before the end of the initial five-year term or any such two-year
extension, the Board determines that it shall not be so extended.  If a Change
of Control occurs while this Plan is in effect, this Plan shall continue in
full force and effect and shall not terminate or expire until after all
Participants who become entitled to any payments hereunder shall have received
such payments in full and all adjustments required to be made pursuant to
Section 4.4 have been made.

     6.2 Amendment or Termination.  The Board may amend or terminate this Plan
at any time; provided, that this Plan may not be terminated or amended (i)
following a Change of Control,  (ii) at the request of a third party who has
taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control, or (iii)
otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control, in any
manner that could adversely affect the rights of any Participant.

     6.3 Procedure for Extension, Amendment or Termination. Any extension,
amendment or termination of this Plan by the Board in accordance with the
foregoing shall be made by action of the Board in accordance with the Company's
charter and by-laws and applicable law, and shall be evidenced by a written
instrument signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, certifying that
the Board has taken such action.


                                  ARTICLE VII
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

     7.1 Indemnification.  If a Participant institutes any legal action in
seeking to obtain or enforce, or is required to defend in any legal action the
validity or enforceability of, any right or benefit provided by this Plan, the
Company will pay for all actual legal fees and expenses incurred (as incurred)
by such Participant, regardless of the outcome of such action.

     7.2 Employment Status.  This Plan does not constitute a contract of
employment, nor does it impose on the Participant or the Company any obligation
for the Participant to remain an Employee or change the status of the
Participant's employment or the Company's policies regarding termination of
employment.

     7.3 Named Fiduciary; Administration.  The Company is the named fiduciary
of the Plan, with full authority to control and manage the operation and
administration of the Plan, acting through the Employee Benefits Department.

     7.4 Claim Procedure.  If an Employee or former Employee makes a written
request alleging a right to receive benefits under this Plan or alleging a right
to receive an adjustment in benefits being paid under the Plan, the Company
shall treat it as a claim for benefit.  All claims for benefit under the Plan
shall be sent to the Employee Benefits Department and must be received within
30 days after 


                                    - 10 -

termination of employment.  If the Company determines that any individual who
has claimed a right to receive benefits, or different benefits, under the Plan
is not entitled to receive all or any part of the benefits claimed, it will
inform the claimant in writing of its determination and the reasons therefor in
terms calculated to be understood by the claimant.  The notice will be sent
within 90 days of the claim unless the Company determines additional time,
not exceeding 90 days, is needed.  The notice shall make specific reference to
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, and describe any
additional material or information is necessary.  Such notice shall, in
addition, inform the claimant what procedure the claimant should follow to take
advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the event the claimant
desires to contest the denial of the claim.  The claimant may within 90 days
thereafter submit in writing to the Company a notice that the claimant contests
the denial of his or her claim by the Company and desires a further review.  The
Company shall within 60 days thereafter review the claim and authorize the
claimant to appear personally and review pertinent documents and submit issues
and comments relating to the claim to the persons responsible for making the
determination on behalf of the Company.  The Company will render its final
decision with specific reasons therefor in writing and will transmit it to the
claimant within 60 days of the written request for review, unless the Company
determines additional time, not exceeding 60 days, is needed, and so notifies
the Participant.  If the Company fails to respond to a claim filed in accordance
with the foregoing within 60 days or any such extended period, the Company shall
be deemed to have denied the claim.

     7.5 Unfunded Plan Status.  This Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan
maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a
select group of management or highly compensated employees, within the meaning
of Section 401 of ERISA.  All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from
the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be
established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment.  No
Participant or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in
any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating
in the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (but shall not be
obligated to) create one or more grantor trusts, the assets of which are
subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, to assist it in accumulating
funds to pay its obligations under the Plan.

     7.6 Validity and Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of the Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and
any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     7.7 Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of the Plan shall in all respects be governed by the laws of
Missouri, without reference to principles of conflict of law, except to the
extent pre-empted by ERISA.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Union Electric Company


In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
income, long-term debt, preferred stock, retained earnings, other paid-in
capital, and cash flows appearing on pages 22-36 of this report present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Union Electric Company at

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Union Electric and CIPSCO Incorporated entered into a Merger Agreement dated
August 11, 1995, which was later approved by the shareholders of both companies
in December 1995.  The merged entity is expected to realize $590 million in
savings over 10 years from combining certain operations of the two companies
and is expected to adopt Union Electric's dividend payment level.  However, the
merger is conditioned upon, among other things, receipt of certain regulatory
and governmental approvals.  The merger is expected to be consummated in early
1997.  See Note 2 - Merger Agreement under Notes to Financial Statements for
further information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Common stock earnings and earnings per share for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $301
million ($2.95 per share), $308 million ($3.01 per share) and $283
million ($2.77 per share), respectively.  Earnings and earnings per share
fluctuated due to many conditions, the primary ones being:  weather variations,
electric rate reductions, credits to electric customers, sales growth,
fluctuating operating costs including Callaway nuclear refueling outages,
merger transaction costs, new accounting requirements, changes in interest
expense and changes in income and property taxes.
     The impacts of the more significant items affecting revenues, costs and
earnings during the past several years are analyzed and discussed below.

</TABLE>


     The increase in 1995 electric revenues is due to increased sales of 4%
over 1994, mainly due to unusually hot weather in the third quarter and to
sales growth reflecting the Company's healthy service area economy.
Weather-sensitive residential and commercial sales increased 6% and 3%,
respectively, over 1994 while industrial sales rose 3%.  These revenue
increases were partially offset by the one-time $30 million credit and the 1.8%
rate decrease for Missouri electric customers.  See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters 
under Notes to Financial Statements for further information.
     The increase in 1994 electric revenues reflects growth in sales to
commercial and industrial customers of 4% and 2%, respectively, offset by
reduced sales to residential customers of 2%, primarily due to milder weather
in the first and third quarters of 1994 compared to 1993.
     The increase in 1993 electric revenues primarily reflects increased sales
from colder, more normal winter weather in the first quarter 1993 followed by
warmer spring and summer weather when compared to 1992.  These increased
revenues were partially offset by the November 1992 Missouri rate settlement,
effective January 1, 1993, which decreased rates for all Missouri electric
customers and reduced annual revenues by approximately $42 million.
     The variation in electric revenues attributable to growth and other
factors in 1993, 1994 and 1995 largely reflects the differences in economic
growth in the Company's service territory for these periods.  In 1993,
normalized kilowatthour sales decreased approximately 1% reflecting the loss of
sales from disposition of our Iowa and northern Illinois service territory,
partially offset by an improved economy in other parts of our service
territory.  In 1995 and 1994, normalized kilowatthours increased 2% and 3%,
respectively, over the prior year, demonstrating a growing local economy.
Other less significant factors contributing to variations in electric sales are
conservation, installation of energy-efficient appliances, and changes to and
from alternate fuels.

<PAGE>   3
     The increased 1995 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect increased net
purchased power costs due to greater electric sales during the hot 1995 summer
and the need for replacement power during Callaway's spring refueling outage.
The decreased 1994 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect lower fuel prices
resulting from increased use of low-sulfur coal at our fossil fuel power plants
and greater generation at our nuclear plant due to the absence of a refueling
outage in 1994.  Higher generation, resulting in greater fuel costs, was more
than offset by reduced net purchased power costs.  The increased 1993 Fuel and
Purchased Power costs reflect a rise in purchased power and lower generating
efficiencies, partly offset by more hydro generation and reduced fossil-fueled
generation.  Increased power purchases from other utilities were required in
1993 when flooding in the Midwest interrupted coal deliveries to several of the
Company's power plants.
     Other operating expenses variations in 1993 through 1995 reflect recurring
conditions such as growth, inflation, and wage and benefit increases.  In 1995,
operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, decreased $17
million, mainly due to a $9 million reduction in natural gas purchased for
resale, a $6 million decrease in employee benefits expense, a $9 million
decrease in injuries, damages and insurance premiums partially offset by a $5
million increase in labor costs and increased material and supplies costs.  In
1994, operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, decreased
$10 million, primarily due to a $7 million reduction in natural gas purchased
for resale, a $5 million decrease in labor costs, and a $3 million decrease in
employee benefit expenses, partially offset by increased provision for injuries
and damages and higher consulting and communications expenses.  In 1993,
operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs increased $64
million, primarily due to a $32 million increase in employee postretirement
benefits expense pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than
Pensions", a $14 million increase in natural gas purchased for resale, a $5
million increase in labor costs, and higher pensions, professional and computer
services, regulatory fees and provision for injuries and damages.

     In 1995, maintenance expenses increased $24 million, mainly due to a $28
million increase in power plant maintenance, partially offset by reduced
distribution system maintenance.  Callaway Plant's maintenance expenses
increased $17 million primarily due to the Spring 1995 nuclear refueling
outage.  Maintenance at other power plants increased $11 million primarily due
to scheduled maintenance outages.  In 1994, maintenance expenses increased $8
million, mainly caused by additional maintenance expenses at our fossil fuel
power plants and greater tree-trimming expense, partly offset by lower Callaway
Plant maintenance (no refueling outage in 1994) and reduced labor costs.  In
1993, maintenance expenses increased $3 million primarily due to flood-related
labor expenses.
     Depreciation increased $7 million in 1995 and $6 million in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, due to increased depreciable property.

TAXES

Income taxes from operations increased $3 million in 1995 primarily due to a
higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower pre-tax income.     
The $27 million increase in 1994 income taxes resulted from higher pre-tax
income and a higher effective Missouri income tax rate.  1993 income taxes from
operations reflected a higher federal income tax rate offset by lower pre-tax
income.
      In 1995, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $2 million 
due to increased gross receipts taxes from greater electric sales and increased 
real estate taxes.  In 1994, other taxes charged to operating expenses rose     
$4 million due to increased real estate taxes and greater corporate franchise
taxes.  In 1993, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $6 million
from higher gross receipts and real estate taxes.

OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS

Miscellaneous other net income and deductions decreased $6 million for 1995,
primarily due to $9 million of merger-related expenses.  See Note 2-Merger
Agreement under Notes to Financial Statements.

INTEREST

In 1995, interest expense declined $6 million as decreases in other interest
expense were partly offset by higher interest rates on variable rate long-term
debt.  In 1994, interest expense increased $12 million generally

<PAGE>   4


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

due to a greater amount of total debt outstanding and overall higher interest
rates on variable rate debt.  In 1993, interest expenses decreased $6 million
primarily due to the refinancing of high-cost debt with lower cost issues,
lower interest rates on variable rate debt and a reduction in total debt
outstanding.

BALANCE SHEET

The $37.5 million increase (16%) in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues
at December 31, 1995 is due primarily to increased revenues of 8% for the
months of November and December 1995, compared to the corresponding period in
1994, coupled with increased budget billing accounts receivable balances
resulting from the hot summer weather in 1995.
     Changes in the accounts payable, income taxes accrued and other taxes
accrued balances are related largely to the timing of various payments to
taxing authorities and suppliers.

RATE MATTERS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $640 million for 1995, compared
to $544 million and $627 million during 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $341 million, $333 million
and $292 million for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  1995 expenditures for constructing new or improving existing
facilities, purchasing rail cars and expenditures for complying with the Clean
Air Act were $311 million.  In addition, the Company spent $42 million to
acquire nuclear fuel.

     The Company completed Callaway Plant construction in late 1984.  The need
for additional base load electric generation capacity is not anticipated until
after the year 2013.  Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company
is required to reduce total annual sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately
two-thirds by 2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide are also
required.  By switching to low-sulfur coal and using early banking of emission
credits, the Company anticipates that no significant revenue increases will be
required.  The related capital costs, currently estimated at about   $300
million, are largely offset by lower fuel costs.  At December 31, 1995, about
75% of the Clean Air Act-related capital costs had been spent.
     See Note 14 - Callaway nuclear plant under Notes to Financial Statements
for a discussion of Callaway Plant decommissioning costs.
     Cash flows used in financing activities were $299 million for 1995
compared to $211 million and $336 million during 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The Company's principal financing activities during 1995 were the redemption of
$38 million of First Mortgage Bonds and the payment of dividends.
     Ratings on the Company's First Mortgage Bonds are as follows:

     The Company plans to continue utilizing short-term debt to support normal
operations and other temporary requirements.  The Company is authorized by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to have up to $600 million of short-term
unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any one time.  Short-term borrowings
of the Company consist of bank loans (maturities generally on an overnight
basis) andcommercial paper(maturities generally within 10 to 45 days).  The
Company has committed bank lines of credit aggregating $184 million which make
available interim financing at various rates of interest based on


20 UNION ELECTRIC 1995 Annual Report

<PAGE>   5


LIBOR, the bank certificate of deposit rate, or other options, and in support
of which the Company pays to its lending banks annual fees up to 0.10%.  At
December 31, 1995, $20 million of bank loans were outstanding.  The lines of
credit are renewable annually at various dates through the year.  The Company
also has bank credit agreements due 1998 and 1999 which permit the Company to
borrow up to $300 million and $200 million, respectively, on a long-term basis.
     The Company has a lease agreement which provides for the financing of
nuclear fuel.  At December 31, 1995, the maximum amount which may be financed
under the agreement is $120 million.  Cash provided from financing for 1995
included issuances for nuclear fuel of $49 million offset by $70 million of
redemptions.  At December 31, 1995, $97 million was financed under the lease.
See Note 6 - Nuclear Fuel Lease under Notes to Financial Statements for further
information.

CONTINGENCIES

See Note 13 - Contingencies under Notes to Financial Statements for material
issues existing at December 31, 1995.

DIVIDENDS

On October 13, 1995, UE's Board of Directors increased the quarterly common
stock dividend to 62.5 cents per share from 61 cents, raising the indicated
annualized common stock dividend to $2.50 per share.  Common stock dividends
paid for the year ended December 31, 1995, resulted in a pay out rate of 83% of
the Company's earnings to common stockholders.  Dividends paid to the Company's
common stockholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities
for the same period were 39%.
     The Board of Directors does not set specific targets or payout parameters
for dividend payments.  In its annual review of dividend payments, however, the
Board considers various issues: the Company's historic earnings and cash flow,
including the Company's projected earnings, cash flow and potential cash flow
requirements; dividend increases at other utilities; return on investments with
similar risk characteristics and overall business considerations.

OUR STRATEGY

The Company's management and Board of Directors recognize the increasing
probability of more intense competition in the utility industry in the future.
Although no one can accurately predict the timing or precise nature of this
competition, the Company operates its business assuming this competition will
occur.  Union Electric's basic business strategy is 1) to improve our
competitive position by continually enhancing customer service; 2) to maintain
competitive electric rates and 3) to reduce costs to the lowest levels possible
without compromising customer service, employee safety, environmental
stewardship, fair returns to stockholders and fair rewards to employees.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of (FAS 121).  This statement establishes standards for
determining the impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangible assets.  In addition, FAS 121 requires that regulatory assets that
are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues be charged to
earnings.  FAS 121 is effective January 1, 1996 and is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations
upon adoption.
     In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (FAS 123).  FAS 123 permits companies to adopt a new method of
accounting for stock compensation awards based on their estimated fair value at
the date the awards are granted, or for companies to continue their current
method of accounting for stock compensation awards.  The Company will utilize
its current method of accounting for stock compensation awards.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The current replacement cost of the Company's utility plant substantially
exceeds its recorded historical cost.  Under existing regulatory practice, only
the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As a result, cash
flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs through
depreciation may not be adequate to replace plant in future years.  However,
past practice indicates the Company will be allowed to earn on and to recover
the increased cost of replacing facilities when this occurs.  The impact on
common stockholders is mitigated to the extent depreciable property is financed
with debt that is repaid with dollars of less purchasing power.

Net Income and Earnings on Common Stock for the second quarter of 1995 reflect
the Callaway Plant refueling, the effect of which decreased earnings on common
stock approximately $20 million, or 20 cents per share.  Net Income and Earnings
on Common Stock for the  third quarter of 1995 reflect a one-time credit to
Missouri electric customers, the effect of which reduced earnings on common
stock approximately $18 million, or 18 cents per share.  In addition, a 1.8%
rate decrease in 1995 for Missouri electric customers reduced Net Income and
Earnings on Common Stock for the third and fourth quarters by $4 million, or 
4 cents per share in each of the quarters.  Also, merger transaction costs of $9
million, which are classified in Other Income and Deductions, reduced Net Income
and Earnings on Common Stock approximately 9 cents per share in the third
quarter of 1995. Other changes in quarterly earnings are due to the effect of
weather on sales and other factors which are characteristic of public utility
operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC),
Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC).  The accounting policies of the Company are in accordance
with the ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction
and, as such, conform to generally accepted accounting principles as applied to
regulated public utilities.  Following is a description of the Company's
significant accounting policies:

PROPERTY AND PLANT

The cost of additions to and betterments of units of property and plant is
capitalized.  Cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, and overheads,
plus an allowance for funds used during construction. Maintenance expenditures
and the renewal of items not considered units of property are charged to income
as incurred.  When units of depreciable property are retired, the original cost
and removal cost, less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various classes of
depreciable property by applying composite rates on a straight-line basis.  The
provision for depreciation in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was approximately 3% of the
average depreciable cost.

NUCLEAR FUEL

The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a unit-of-production
basis.  Spent fuel disposal cost is charged to expense based on kilowatthours
sold.

INCOME TAXES

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of
transactions that have been treated differently for financial reporting and tax
return purposes, measured using statutory tax rates.
     Investment tax credits utilized in prior years were deferred and are being
amortized over the useful lives of the properties to which they relate.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED
DURING CONSTRUCTION

Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC) is a utility industry
accounting practice whereby the cost of borrowed funds and the cost of equity
funds (preferred and common stockholders' equity) applicable to the Company's
construction program are capitalized as a cost of construction.  This
accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of financing
current construction, and treats such financing costs in the same manner as
construction charges for labor and materials.
     Under accepted rate-making practice, cash recovery of AFC, as well as
other construction costs, occurs when completed projects are placed in service
and reflected in customer rates.
     AFC rates are determined by the Company consistent with  the methodology
prescribed by the FERC. Average annual AFC rates were 9.3% in 1995, 8.9% in
1994 and 7.8% in 1993.

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE

Discount, premium and expense associated with long-term debt are amortized over
the lives of the related issues.  Gains or losses related to refunded debt are
amortized over the lives of the related new debt issues or the remaining life
of the old debt issues if no new debt is issued.

REVENUE
The Company accrues on its books estimated, but unbilled, revenue.
     Operating Revenues include excise taxes of $99.2 million, $97.9 million
and $97.8 million for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE 2 - MERGER AGREEMENT

On August 11, 1995, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the Merger Agreement) with CIPSCO Incorporated (CIPSCO) and Ameren Corporation
(Ameren), a newly formed entity, 50% owned by the Company and 50% owned by
CIPSCO, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company and CIPSCO will be
merged with Ameren (the Merger).  Subsequent to the Merger, the Company and
Central Illinois Public Service Company and CIPSCO Investment Company (wholly
owned subsidiaries of CIPSCO), will continue as wholly owned operating
subsidiaries of Ameren.  As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of
the Company's common stock will be

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of Ameren (Ameren
Common Stock), each outstanding share of the Company's preferred stock will
remain outstanding and unchanged and each outstanding share of CIPSCO's common
stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.03 shares of Ameren Common
Stock (or cash in lieu of fractional shares).  The Merger is expected to be
tax-free for income tax purposes and will be accounted for under the "pooling
of interests" method of accounting.
     With their execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Company and
CIPSCO entered into stock option agreements, pursuant to one of which the
Company granted CIPSCO the right, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to purchase up to 6,983,233 shares of the Company's common
stock at a price of $35.94 per share.  Pursuant to the other agreements, CIPSCO
granted the Company the right, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, to purchase up to 6,779,838 shares of CIPSCO common stock at a
price of $37.02 per share.  These options will expire upon consummation of the
Merger.
     After the Merger, Ameren will become a registered public utility holding
company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.  In
December 1995, the Merger was approved by the shareholders of Union Electric
and CIPSCO.  However, the Merger is still conditioned upon, among other things,
receipt of certain regulatory and governmental approvals (See Note 3 -
Regulatory Matters).
     The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the
effects of combining Union Electric and CIPSCO into Ameren under the pooling of
interests method of accounting.

     The pro forma financial information consolidates the financial results of
Electric Energy Inc. (EEI), which effectively will be 60% owned by Ameren
subsequent to the merger as a result of the current ownership interests in EEI
by Union Electric and CIPS.

NOTE 3 - REGULATORY MATTERS

The Company has filed an application for approval of the Merger with the MoPSC,
and CIPSCO and the Company have filed joint applications for approval of the
merger with the ICC and the FERC.  In those applications, the Company and
CIPSCO are requesting a sharing of merger savings, net of merger premium and
transaction costs, between ratepayers and shareholders for the first 10 years
subsequent to the Merger.
     On July 21, 1995, the MoPSC approved an agreement involving the Company's
Missouri electric rates.  The agreement decreased rates 1.8% for all classes of
Missouri retail electric customers, effective August 1, 1995, reducing annual
revenues by about $30 million.  In addition, a one-time $30 million credit to
current Missouri electric customers reduced 1995 earnings approximately 18
cents per share.  Also included is a three-year plan which provides that
earnings in any future years in excess of a 12.61% return on equity (determined
on a regulatory basis) will be shared equally between customers and
stockholders and earnings above a 14% return on equity will be credited to
customers.  Also, the agreement provides that no party shall file for a general
increase or decrease in the Company's Missouri retail electric rates prior to
July 1, 1998, except that the Company may file for an increase if certain
adverse events occur.  At this time, the Company is unable to determine whether
it will be required to make any future credits to its customers under the
agreement.
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had recorded the following regulatory
assets and regulatory liabilities:

</TABLE>


     The Company continually assesses the recoverability of its regulatory
assets.  Under current accounting standards, regulatory assets are written-off
to earnings when it is probable that such amounts will not be recovered through
future revenues.

<PAGE>   15



     The Company is currently involved in proceedings with the FERC related to
various accounting matters.  The Company believes that the final disposition of
these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 4 - DEBT RETIREMENT PROVISIONS

During the five years from December 31, 1995, the amounts of debt maturities
totaling $214 million are: $69 million in 1996; $45 million in 1997; and $100
million in 1999.  Amounts for years subsequent to 1996 do not include nuclear
fuel lease payments since the amounts of such payments are not currently
determinable.
     Debt retirement provisions in some mortgage bond indentures of the Company
require, subject to certain alternatives, the annual redemption of 1% of the
principal amount (as defined) of each series of bonds.  In substantially all
instances, as permitted by the indentures, the Company has pledged property
additions in lieu of such redemptions.

NOTE 5 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings of the Company consist of bank loans (maturities
generally on an overnight basis) and commercial paper (maturities generally
within 10-45 days). At December 31, 1995, $19,600,000 of bank loans were
outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding for
the year ended December 31, 1995 was 6.1%.
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had committed bank lines of credit
aggregating $184 million (of which $164 million were unused) which make
available interim financing at various rates of interest based on LIBOR, the
bank certificate of deposit rate, or other options, and in support of which the
Company pays to its lending banks annual fees up to 0.10%. These lines of
credit are renewable annually at various dates throughout the year.

NOTE 6 - NUCLEAR FUEL LEASE

The Company has a lease agreement which provides for the financing of nuclear
fuel.  The maximum amount which may be financed under the agreement is $120
million. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the Company has assigned to the
lessor certain contracts for purchase of nuclear fuel. The lessor obtains,
through the issuance of commercial paper or from direct loans under a committed
revolving credit agreement from commercial banks, the necessary funds to
purchase the fuel and make interest payments when due.
     The Company is obligated to reimburse the lessor for all expenditures for
nuclear fuel, interest and related costs. Obligations under this lease become
due as the nuclear fuel is consumed at the Company's Callaway nuclear plant.
The Company reimbursed the lessor $34.1 million during 1995, $34.5 million
during 1994 and $55.0 million during 1993.
     The Company has capitalized the cost, including certain interest costs, of
the leased nuclear fuel and has recorded the related lease obligation.  During
the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, the total interest charges under the lease were
$5.8 million, $5.2 million and $3.1 million (based on average interest rates of
6.1%, 4.7% and 3.6%, respectively) of which $2.5 million, $2.7 million and
$1.4 million, respectively, were capitalized.

NOTE 7 - PREFERRED STOCK

During the three years ended December 31, 1995, preferred stock, without par
value, was issued or redeemed as follows: issued 1,657,500 shares, $1.735
Series and 330,000 shares, $7.64 Series in 1993; redeemed 350,000 shares, $8.00
Series and 425,000 shares, $8.00 Series of 1971 in 1993.  The Company retired
260 shares, $6.30 Series in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

NOTE 8 - PREFERRED STOCK MANDATORY REDEMPTION PROVISIONS

During each of the years 1996 through 2000, the Company will be required to
redeem $26,000 of the $6.30 Series of preferred stock outstanding at December
31, 1995.

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES

Total income tax expense for 1995 resulted in an effective tax rate of 40% on
earnings before income taxes (39% in 1994 and 38% in 1993). The principal
reasons such rates differ from the statutory Federal rate are as follows:

     The Company recognizes the income tax effects of temporary differences.
Prior to 1993, in accordance with accepted ratemaking practice, deferred income
taxes were not provided for certain temporary differences flowed through to
customers and the equity component of AFC.  In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," a Regulatory Asset, representing the probable
recovery from customers of future income taxes which is expected to occur when
temporary differences reverse, has been recorded along with a corresponding
deferred tax liability.  Also, a Regulatory Liability recognizing the lower
expected revenue resulting from reduced income taxes associated with amortizing
accumulated deferred investment tax credits, has been recorded.  The deferred
tax asset corresponding to this Regulatory Liability has been combined with the
deferred tax liabilities.
     The Company adjusts its deferred tax liabilities for changes enacted in
tax laws or rates.  Recognizing that regulators will probably reduce future
revenues for deferred tax liabilities initially recorded at rates in excess of
the current statutory rate, reductions in the deferred tax liability were
credited to the Regulatory Liability.
     Temporary differences gave rise to deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities at year-end 1995 and 1994 as follows (in millions):

The Company has non-contributory, defined-benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all of its employees. Benefits are based on the employees' years
of service and compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute
annually at least the minimum amount required by government funding standards,
but not more than can be deducted for Federal income taxes. Plan assets consist
principally of common stocks and fixed income securities.
     Pension costs for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, were $26 million, $31
million and $27 million, respectively, of which 20% was charged to construction
accounts in 1995 and approximately 18% in each of the years 1994 and 1993.
     The plans' funded status follows (in millions):

     In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.  Substantially
all of the Company's employees may become eligible for those benefits if they
reach retirement age while working for the Company.  For 1995, 1994 and 1993,
the actual claims paid were $15.4 million, $15.6 million and $14.6 million,
respectively.
     The Company accrues the expected postretirement benefit costs during
employees' years of service.  Postretirement benefit costs for the years 1995,
1994 and 1993 were $44 million, $46 million and $53 million, respectively, of
which 19% was charged to construction accounts in 1995 and approximately 18%
was charged to construction accounts in each of the years 1994 and 1993.  The
Company's transition obligation at December 31, 1995 is being amortized over
the next 17 years.
     In August 1994, the MoPSC authorized the recovery of postretirement
benefit costs in rates to the extent that such costs are funded.  In 1995, the
Company established two external trust funds for retiree healthcare and life
insurance benefits.  Assets in these trusts amounted to $14.2 million at
December 31, 1995 and were invested primarily in short-term instruments.

NOTE 11 - STOCK OPTION PLANS

In April, 1995, the Company's shareholders approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the Plan) for eligible employees, as determined by the Human Resources
Committee of the Board.  The Plan provides for the grant of options,
performance awards, restricted stock, dividend equivalents and stock
appreciation rights.

                                  UNION ELECTRIC 1995 Annual Report         33

<PAGE>   18
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     Under the terms of the Plan, options may be granted at a price not less
than the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant.  Granted options
vest over a period of five years, beginning at the date of grant and provide
for acceleration of exercisability of the options upon the occurrence of
certain events, including retirement.  At December 31, 1995, a total of
2,500,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Plan; however, the
Company expects to make open market purchases of its common stock to meet the
requirements of the Plan.

     Presented below is a summary of activity for the Plan for the year ended
December 31, 1995:

NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS

The Company is engaged in a construction program under which expenditures
averaging approximately $288 million, including AFC, are anticipated during
each of the next five years.
     In addition, the Company has commitments for the purchase of coal under
long-term contracts.  Coal contract commitments for 1996 through 2000 are
estimated to be $871 million (excluding contract escalation provisions).  Total
coal purchases for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $293 million, $268 million and $367
million, respectively.  The Company also has existing contracts with pipeline
and natural gas suppliers to provide natural gas for distribution and electric
generation.  Total delivered natural gas costs for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $60
million, $63 million and $80 million, respectively.  Gas related contracted
cost commitments for 1996 through 2000 are estimated to be $98 million.  The
Company's nuclear fuel commitments for 1996 through 2000, including uranium
concentrates, conversion, enrichment and fabrication, are expected to total
$134 million, which is expected to be financed under the nuclear fuel lease.
Nuclear fuel expenditures for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $42 million, $30 million
and $37 million, respectively.

 (a)  Retrospective premium under the Price-Anderson liability provisions of
      the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (Price-Anderson).  Subject to
      retrospective assessment with respect to loss from an incident at any
      U.S. reactor, payable at $10 million per year.
 (b)  Limit of liability for each incident under Price-Anderson.
 (c)  Total industry potential liability from workers claiming exposure to
      the hazard of nuclear radiation.  The policy includes an automatic
      reinstatement thereby providing total coverage of $400 million.
 (d)  Includes premature decommissioning costs.
 (e)  Weekly indemnity of $3.1 million, for 52 weeks which commences after
      the first 21 weeks of an outage, plus $2.5 million per week for 104 weeks
      thereafter.

     Price-Anderson limits the liability for claims from an incident involving
any licensed U.S. nuclear facility.  The limit is based on the number of
licensed reactors and is adjusted at least every five years based on the
Consumer Price Index.  Utilities owning a nuclear reactor cover this exposure
through a combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a
financial protection pool as established by Price-Anderson.
     If losses from a nuclear incident at Callaway Plant exceed the limits of,
or are not subject to, insurance, or if coverage is not available, the Company
will self-insure the risk.  Although the Company has no reason to

anticipate a serious nuclear incident, if one did occur it could have a
material but undeterminable adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.
     Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to
reduce total annual sulfur dioxide emissions significantly by the year 2000.
Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  By switching
to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company
anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
significant revenue increases because the related capital costs, estimated at
about $300 million, are largely offset by lower fuel costs.  At year-end 1995,
about 75 percent of the Clean Air Act related capital costs had been expended.
     As of December 31, 1995, the Company was designated a potentially
responsible party (PRP) by federal and state environmental protection agencies
at five hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been
identified for which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated
a PRP.  The Company continually reviews the remediation costs that will be
required for all of these sites.  However, such costs are not expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.
     The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary
course of business, some of which involve substantial amounts. The Company
believes that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

NOTE 14 - CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
DOE currently charges one mill per nuclear generated kilowatthour sold for
future disposal of spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide for
recovery of such costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage
facility for spent fuel available until at least 2015.  The Company has
sufficient storage capacity at the Callaway Plant site until 2005 and has
viable storage alternatives under consideration.  Each alternative will likely
require Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval and may require other regulatory
approvals.  The delayed availability of DOE's disposal facility is not expected
to adversely affect the continued operation of Callaway Plant.
     Electric rates charged to customers provide for recovery of Callaway Plant
decommissioning costs over the life of the plant, based on an assumed 40-year
life, ending with expiration of the plant's operating license in 2024.  The
Callaway site is assumed to be decommissioned using the DECON (immediate
dismantlement) method.  Decommissioning costs, including decontamination,
dismantling and site restoration, are estimated to be $433 million in current
year dollars and are expected to escalate approximately 4% per year through the
end of decommissioning activity in 2033.  The Company's previous
decommissioning cost estimate, which was completed in 1993, estimated
decommissioning costs to be      $383 million in 1993 dollars.  Decommissioning
costs are charged to depreciation expense over Callaway's service life and
amounted to $6.7 million in each of the years 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Every three
years, the MoPSC requires the Company to file updated cost studies for
decommissioning Callaway, and electric rates may be adjusted at such times to
reflect changed estimates.  Costs collected from customers are deposited in an
external trust fund to provide for Callaway's decommissioning.  Fund earnings
are expected to average 9.25% annually through the date of decommissioning.  If
the assumed return on trust assets is not earned, the Company believes it is
probable that such earnings deficiency will be recovered in rates.  Trust fund
earnings, net of expenses, appear on the balance sheet as increases in Nuclear
decommissioning trust fund and in the Accumulated Provision for Nuclear
Decommissioning.
     The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned certain
of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry, including
the Company, regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in the financial
statements of electric utilities.  In response to these questions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has agreed to review the accounting
for removal costs, including decommissioning.  If current electric utility
industry accounting practices for such decommissioning are changed (1) the
annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2) trust fund income
from the external decommissioning trusts could be reported as investment income
rather than as a reduction to decommissioning expense.  The Company does not
expect that changes in the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs will
have a material effect on its results of operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 15 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value.

CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS/
SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity
of these instruments.

NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUND
The fair value of the Company's Nuclear decommissioning trust fund is estimated
based on quoted market prices for securities.

PREFERRED STOCK
The fair value of the Company's preferred stock outstanding is estimated based
on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

LONG-TERM DEBT
The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to
the Company for debt of comparable maturities.

     The estimated fair value of the Company's Preferred Stock and Long-Term
Debt as of December 31, is shown below:

</TABLE>



     The Company's investments in debt and equity securities are held in trust
funds for the purpose of funding the nuclear decommissioning of the Callaway
nuclear plant.  See Note 14 - Callaway Nuclear Plant.  The Company has
classified all investments in debt and equity securities as available for sale
and has recorded all such investments at their fair market value at December
31, 1995 and 1994.  In 1995, 1994 and 1993, the proceeds from the sale of
investments were $9.4 million, $22.2 million and $68.9 million, respectively.
Using the specific identification method to determine cost, the gross realized
gains on those sales were $.4 million, $.6 million and $1.7 million,
respectively, for 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Net realized and unrealized gains and
losses are reflected in Accumulated Provision for Nuclear Decommissioning on
the Balance Sheet, which is consistent with the method used by the Company to
account for the decommissioning costs recovered in rates.  The recorded fair
values and cost basis of the Company's debt and equity investments shown in the
Nuclear decommissioning trust fund are as follows:
