 ITEM  1.  BUSINESS.

                                    GENERAL

         The registrant, Union Electric Company (the "Company"), incorporated in
 Missouri in 1922, is successor to a number of companies, the oldest of which
 was organized in 1881.  The Company, which is the largest electric utility in
 the State of Missouri, supplies electric service in territories in Missouri and
 Illinois having an estimated population of 2,600,000 within an area of
 approximately 24,500 square miles, including the greater St. Louis area.
 Natural gas purchased from non-affiliated pipeline companies is distributed in
 90 Missouri communities and in the City of Alton, Illinois and vicinity.

         For the year 1993, 95.2% of total operating revenues was derived from
 the sale of electric energy and 4.8% from the sale of natural gas.  Electric
 operating revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues for the years
 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992 were 96%, 95.9%, 95.7%, and 95.7% respectively.

         The Company employed 6,417 persons at December 31, 1993.  Approximately
 70% of the Company's employees are represented by local unions affiliated with
 the AFL-CIO.  Labor agreements representing approximately 4,400 employees will
 expire in 1996.  One agreement covering 107 employees expires in 1994, and one
 agreement covering 21 employees will expire in 1997.



                       CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND FINANCING

         The Company is engaged in a construction program under which
 expenditures averaging approximately $310 million are anticipated during each
 of the next five years.  Capital expenditures for compliance with the Clean Air
 Act Amendments of 1990 are included in the construction program -- also see
 "Regulation", below.  The Company does not anticipate a need for additional
 electric generating capacity before the year 2000.

         During the five-year period ended 1993 gross additions to the property
 of the Company, including allowance for funds used during construction and
 excluding nuclear fuel, were approximately $1.2 billion (including $266 million
 in 1993) and property retirements were $190 million.

         In addition to the funds required for construction during the 1994-1998
 period, $174 million will be required to repay long-term debt and preferred
 stock as follows:  $31 million in 1994, $38 million in 1995, $60 million in
 1996, and $45 million in 1997.  Amounts for years subsequent to 1994 do not
 include nuclear fuel lease payments since the amounts of such payments are not
 currently determinable.

         For information on the Company's external cash sources, see "Liquidity
 and Capital Resources" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on Page 18
 of the 1993 Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference.

                                      -1-

         Financing Restrictions.  Under the most restrictive earnings test
 contained in the Company's principal Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust
 ("Mortgage") relating to its First Mortgage Bonds ("Bonds"), no Bonds may be
 issued (except in certain refunding operations) unless the Company's net
 earnings available for interest after depreciation for 12 consecutive months
 within the 15 months preceding such issuance are at least two times annual
 interest charges on all Bonds and prior lien bonds then outstanding and to be
 issued (all calculated as provided in the Mortgage).  Such ratio for the 12
 months ended December 31, 1993 was 6.3, which would permit the Company to issue
 an additional $2.9 billion of Bonds (7% annual interest rate assumed).
 Additionally, the Mortgage permits issuance of new bonds up to (a) 60% of
 defined property additions, or (b) the amount of previous bonds retired or to
 be retired, or (c) the amount of cash put up for such purpose.  At December 31,
 1993, the aggregate amount of Bonds issuable under (a) and (b) above was
 approximately $1.5 billion.  The Company's Articles of Incorporation restrict
 the Company from selling Preferred Stock unless its net earnings for a period
 of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding such sale are at least two
 and one-half times the annual dividend requirements on its Preferred Stock then
 outstanding and to be issued.  Such ratio for the 12 months ended December 31,
 1993 was 22.0, which would permit the Company to issue an additional $1.5
 billion stated value of Preferred Stock (7% annual dividend rate assumed).
 Certain other financing arrangements require the Company to obtain prior
 consents to various actions by the Company, including any future borrowings,
 except for permitted financings such as borrowings under revolving credit
 agreements, the nuclear fuel lease, unsecured short-term borrowings (subject to
 certain conditions), and the issuance of additional Bonds.


                                     RATES

         For the year 1993, approximately 89%, 8%, and 3% of the Company's
 electric operating revenues were based on rates regulated by Missouri Public
 Service Commission, Illinois Commerce Commission, and the Federal Energy
 Regulatory Commission ("FERC") of the Department of Energy, respectively.

         For additional information on rates, see the penultimate paragraph of
 Note 10 to the "Notes to Financial Statements" on Page 32 of the 1993 Annual
 Report pages incorporated herein by reference.

       Coal.  Because of uncertainties of supply due to potential work
 stoppages, equipment breakdowns and other factors, the Company has a policy of
 maintaining a coal inventory of 75 days, based on normal annual burn practices.
 See "Regulation" for additional reference to the Company's coal requirements.

                                      -2-

       Nuclear.  The components of the nuclear fuel cycle required for nuclear
 generating units are as follows:  (1) uranium; (2) conversion of uranium into
 uranium hexafluoride; (3) enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; (4) conversion of
 enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide and the fabrication into
 nuclear fuel assemblies; and (5) disposal and/or reprocessing of spent nuclear
 fuel.

       The Company has contracts to fulfill its needs for uranium, enrichment,
 and fabrication services through 2002.  The Company's contract for conversion
 services is sufficient to supply the Callaway Plant through 1995.  Additional
 contracts will have to be entered into in order to supply nuclear fuel during
 the remainder of the estimated life of the Plant, at prices which cannot now be
 accurately predicted.  The Callaway Plant normally requires re-fueling at 18-
 month intervals and re-fuelings are presently scheduled for the spring of 1995
 and fall of 1996.

       Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U. S. Department of
 Energy (DOE) is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent
 nuclear fuel.  DOE currently charges one mill per kilowatt-hour sold for future
 disposal of spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide for
 recovery of such costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage
 facility for spent fuel available until at least 2010.  The Company has
 sufficient storage capacity at the Callaway Plant site until 2004 and has
 viable storage alternatives under consideration that would provide additional
 storage facilities.  Each alternative will likely require Nuclear Regulatory
 Commission approval and may require other regulatory approvals. The delayed
 availability of DOE's disposal facility is not expected to adversely affect the
 continued operation of the Callaway Plant.

       Oil and Gas.  The actual and prospective use of such fuels is minimal,
 and the Company has not experienced and does not expect to experience
 difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies.



                                   REGULATION

       The Company is subject to regulation by the Missouri Commission and
 Illinois Commission as to rates, service, accounts, issuance of equity
 securities, issuance of debt having a maturity of more than twelve months, and
 various other matters.  The Company is also subject to regulation by the FERC
 as to rates and charges in connection with the transmission of electric energy
 in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate
 commerce, and certain other matters.  Authorization to issue debt having a
 maturity of twelve months or less is obtained from the FERC.

       Operation of the Company's Callaway Plant is subject to regulation by the
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The Company's Facility Operating License for
 the Callaway Plant expires on October 18, 2024.

       The Company's Osage hydroelectric plant and its Taum Sauk pumped-storage
 hydro plant, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to
 certain federal regulations affecting, among other things, the general
 operation and maintenance of the projects.  The Company's license for the Osage
 Plant expires on February 28, 2006, and its license for the Taum Sauk Plant
 expires on June 30, 2010.  The Company's Keokuk Plant and dam located in the
 Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated
 under authority, unlimited in time, granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
       The Company is exempt from the provisions of the Public Utility Holding
 Company Act of 1935, except Section 9(a)(2) relating to the acquisition of
 securities of other public utility companies and Section 11(b)(2) with respect
 to concluding matters relating to the 1974 acquisition of the common stock of a
 former subsidiary.  When the Securities and Exchange Commission approved such
 acquisition it reserved jurisdiction to pass upon the right of the Company to
 retain its gas properties.

       The Company is regulated, in certain of its operations, by air and water
 pollution and hazardous waste regulations at the city, county, state and
 federal levels.  The Company is in substantial compliance with such existing
 regulations.

       Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to
 reduce total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by approximately two-thirds by
 the year 2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.
 With switching to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the
 Company anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
 significant increase in revenue needs because the related capital costs,
 currently estimated at about $300 million, will be largely offset by lower fuel
 costs.  The Company's Clean Air Act compliance program is subject to approval
 by regulatory authorities.

       As of December 31, 1993, the Company was designated a potentially
 responsible party (PRP) by federal and state environmental protection agencies
 for five hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been
 identified for which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated
 a PRP.  The Company is presently investigating the remedial costs that will be
 required for all of these sites.  Such costs are not expected to have a
 material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

       Other aspects of the Company's business are subject to the jurisdiction
 of various regulatory authorities.



                                INDUSTRY ISSUES

       The Company is facing issues common to the electric and gas utility
 industries which have emerged during the past several years.  These issues
 include:  changes in the structure of the industry as a result of amendments to
 federal laws regulating ownership of generating facilities and access to
 transmission systems; continually developing environmental laws, regulations
 and issues; public concern about the siting of new facilities; increasing
 public attention on the potential public health consequences of exposure to
 electric and magnetic fields emanating from power lines and other electric
 sources; proposals for demand side management programs; and public concerns
 about the disposal of nuclear wastes and about global climate issues.  The
 Company is monitoring these issues and is unable to predict at this time what
 impact, if any, these issues will have on its operations or financial
 condition.

       In planning its construction program, the Company is presently utilizing
 a forecast of kilowatthour sales growth of approximately 1.8% and peak load
 growth of 1.0%, each compounded annually, and is providing for a minimum
 reserve margin of approximately 18% to 20% above its anticipated peak load
 requirements.

       See "Operating Statistics", incorporated by reference in Part I of this
 Form 10-K, for information on loads and capability during the five-year period
 ended 1993.

       See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" under "Management's Discussion and
 Analysis" on Pages 17 and 18 of the 1993 Annual Report pages incorporated
 herein by reference for information on the 1992 purchase and sale of certain
 properties.

       The Company is a member of one of the nine regional electric reliability
 councils organized for coordinating the planning and operation of the nation's
 bulk power supply - MAIN (Mid-America Interconnected Network) operating
 primarily in Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri.  The Company has
 interconnections for the exchange of power, directly and through the facilities
 of

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
 others, with fifteen private utilities and with Associated Electric
 Cooperative, Inc., the City of Columbia, Missouri, the Southwestern Power
 Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

       The Company owns 40% of the capital stock of Electric Energy, Inc.
 ("EEI"), the balance of which is held by three other sponsoring companies --
 Kentucky Utilities Company ("KU"), Central Illinois Public Service ("CIPS"),
 and Illinois Power Company ("IP").  EEI owns and operates a generating plant
 with a nominal capacity of 1,000 mW.  As of January 1, 1994, 60% of the plant's
 output is committed to the Paducah Project of the DOE, 20% is committed to KU,
 10% to the Company, and 5% each to IP and CIPS.

       As of December 31, 1993, the Company owned approximately 3,297 circuit
 miles of electric transmission lines and 731 substations with a transformer
 capacity of approximately 44,324,000 kVA.  The Company owns four propane-air
 plants with an aggregate daily natural gas equivalent capacity of 31,590
 million cubic feet and 2,599 miles of gas mains.  Other properties of the
 Company include distribution lines, underground cable, steam distribution
 facilities in Jefferson City, Missouri and office buildings, warehouses,
 garages and repair shops.

       The Company has fee title to all principal plants and other important
 units of property, or to the real property on which such facilities are located
 (subject to mortgage liens securing outstanding indebtedness of the Company and
 to permitted liens and judgment liens, as defined), except that (i) a portion
 of the Osage Plant reservoir, certain facilities at the Sioux Plant, certain of
 the Company's substations and most of its transmission and distribution lines
 and gas mains are situated on lands occupied under leases, easements,
 franchises, licenses or permits; (ii) the United States and/or the State of
 Missouri own, or have or may have, paramount rights to certain lands lying in
 the bed of the Osage River or located between the inner and outer harbor lines
 of the Mississippi River, on which certain generating and other properties of
 the Company are located; and (iii) the United States and/or State of Illinois
 and/or State of Iowa and/or City of Keokuk, Iowa own, or have or may have,
 paramount rights with respect to, certain lands lying in the bed of the
 Mississippi River on which a portion of the Company's Keokuk Plant is located.

       Substantially all of the Company's property and plant is subject to the
 direct first lien of an Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated June 15,
 1937, as amended and supplemented.  As part of the 1983 merger of the Company
 with its utility subsidiaries, the Company assumed the mortgage indenture of
 each subsidiary.  Currently, the prior liens of two former subsidiary
 indentures extend to the property and franchises acquired by the Company from
 such subsidiaries.  Such indentures also contain provisions subjecting to the
 prior lien thereof after-acquired property of the Company constituting (with
 certain exceptions) additions, extensions, improvements, repairs, and
 replacements appurtenant to property acquired in the merger.  In addition, one
 such indenture contains a provision subjecting to the prior lien thereof after-
 acquired property of the Company situated in the territory served by the former
 subsidiary prior to the merger.


 ITEM   3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before
 various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary
 course of business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  Management is
 of the opinion that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a
 material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

         of Union Electric Company



         Our audits of the financial statements referred to in our report dated
         February 2, 1994 appearing on page 19 of the 1993 Annual Report to
         Stockholders of Union Electric Company (which report and financial
         statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form
         10-K) also included an audit of the Financial Statement Schedules
         listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion, these
         Financial Statement Schedules present fairly, in all material respects,
         the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
         related financial statements.

              (2) Additional shares of the Preferred Stock may, subject to the
         provisions of paragraphs (1) and (6) of subdivision (k) below, be
         issued as additional shares of Preferred Stock of any of the series
         designated above or as shares of one or more other series of Preferred
         Stock, with such distinctive serial designations as shall be set forth
         in the resolution or resolutions from time to time adopted by the Board
         of Directors providing for the issue of such stock or in such other
         instrument providing for the issue of such stock as may be required by
         law; and in any such resolution or resolutions or such other
         instrument, as the case may be, with respect to each particular series
         of the Preferred Stock (other than the series designated above) the
         Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to fix, to the extent
         which may be permitted by law,

              (i) the annual dividend rate for the particular series which shall
         not exceed $8 per share, and the date from which dividends on all
         shares of such series issued prior to the record date for the first
         dividend payment date shall be cumulative;

              (ii) the redemption price per share for the particular series
         which (exclusive of accrued and unpaid dividends) shall not exceed $120
         per share;

              (iii) the amount or amounts per share (exclusive of accrued and
         unpaid dividends) for the particular series payable to the holders
         thereof in case of dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
         affairs of the Corporation, but such amount or amounts shall not exceed
         $120 per share;

              (iv) the terms and conditions, if any, upon which shares of the
         particular series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for,
         shares of any other class, including the price or prices or the rate or
         rates of conversion or exchange and the terms of adjustment thereof, if
         any;

              (v) the terms and amount of any sinking fund created for the
         purchase or redemption of the particular series of Preferred Stock; and

              (vi) any other characteristics of, and any restrictive or other
         provisions relating to, the shares of each particular series not
         inconsistent with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, as
         amended, as the Board of Directors may by law be permitted to fix.

         All shares of Preferred Stock of any one series shall be identical with
         each other in all respects except as to the date from which dividends
         thereon shall be cumulative; and all shares of all series shall be of
         equal rank as to dividends and assets with each other, regardless of
         series, and shall be identical with each other in all other respects
         except as hereinbefore provided.

         (b)  Before any dividends on the Common Stock shall be paid or declared
 or set apart for payment, the holders of the Preferred Stock at the time
 outstanding shall be entitled to receive, but only when and as declared, out of
 any funds legally available for the declaration of

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
 dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the respective annual rates
 hereinbefore specified with respect to the series of Preferred Stock designated
 above, or, in the case of Preferred Stock of any other series, at the annual
 dividend rate for the particular series theretofore fixed by the Board of
 Directors as hereinbefore provided, payable quarter-yearly on the fifteenth
 days of February, May, August, and November in each year, to stockholders of
 record on the respective dates, not exceeding forty days preceding such
 dividend payment dates, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in
 advance of the payment of each particular dividend.  Such dividends on shares
 of the Preferred Stock shall be cumulative,

              (1) if issued prior to the record date for the first dividend on
         the shares of such series, then, in the case of the series of Preferred
         Stock designated above, from the respective dates hereinbefore
         specified with respect thereto, or, in the case of Preferred Stock of
         any other series, from the date theretofore fixed for the purpose by
         the Board of Directors as hereinbefore provided;

              (2) if issued during the period commencing immediately after a
         record date for a dividend and terminating at the close of the payment
         date for such dividend, then from said last mentioned dividend payment
         date; and

              (3) otherwise from the quarter-yearly dividend payment date next
         preceding the date of issue of such shares;

 so that if dividends on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall not
 have been paid for all past quarter-yearly dividend periods, and the full
 dividends thereon for the current quarter-yearly dividend period shall not have
 been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, the deficiency shall be fully
 paid or dividends equal thereto declared and set apart for payment, but without
 interest on cumulative dividends, before any dividends shall be declared or any
 distribution made on the Common Stock.  The holders of the Preferred Stock
 shall not be entitled to receive any dividends thereon other than the dividends
 referred to in this subdivision (b).

         (c)  The Corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may
 redeem the whole or any part of the Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, or
 the whole or any part of any series thereof, at any time or from time to time,
 by paying, in the case of the series of Preferred Stock designated above, the
 respective redemption prices hereinbefore specified with respect thereto, or,
 in the case of Preferred Stock of any other series, by paying such redemption
 price therefor as shall have been fixed by the Board of Directors as
 hereinbefore provided, together with a sum, in the case of each share so to be
 redeemed, computed at the annual dividend rate for the series of which the
 particular share is a part from the date from which dividends on such share
 became cumulative to the date fixed for such redemption, less the aggregate of
 the dividends theretofore or on such redemption date paid thereon.  Notice of
 every such redemption shall be given by publication, published at least once in
 each of two calendar weeks in a daily newspaper printed in the English language
 and published and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
 of New York, and in a like newspaper published and of general circulation in
 the City of St. Louis, Missouri, the first

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
 publication to be at least thirty days and not more than sixty days prior to
 the date fixed for such redemption.  At least thirty days' and not more than
 sixty days' previous notice of every such redemption shall also be mailed to
 the holders of record of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at their
 respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the Corporation;
 but no failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein or in the mailing
 thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
 shares of the Preferred Stock so to be redeemed.  In case of the redemption of
 a part only of any series of the Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the
 Corporation shall select by lot or in such other manner as the Board of
 Directors may determine, the shares so to be redeemed.  The Board of Directors
 shall have full power and authority, subject to the limitations and provisions
 herein contained, to prescribe the manner in which and the terms and conditions
 upon which the Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.  If such
 notice of redemption shall have been duly given by publication, and if on or
 before the redemption date specified in such notice all funds necessary for
 such redemption shall have been set aside so as to be available therefor, then,
 notwithstanding that any certificate for the shares of the Preferred Stock so
 called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for redemption, the
 shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding in the hands
 of the persons who are the holders thereof immediately preceding such
 redemption, the right of such holders to receive dividends thereon shall cease
 to accrue from and after the date of redemption so fixed, and all rights of
 such holders with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock so called for
 redemption shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except
 only the right of such holders to receive the amount payable upon redemption
 thereof, but without interest; provided, however, that the Corporation may,
 after giving the first notice by publication of any such redemption, or giving
 irrevocable instructions therefor, and prior to the redemption date specified
 in such notice, deposit in trust, for the account of the holders of the
 Preferred Stock to be redeemed, with a bank or trust company in good standing,
 organized under the laws of the United States of America or of the State of New
 York, doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, having
 a capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $5,000,000, all
 funds necessary for such redemption, and thereupon all shares of the Preferred
 Stock with respect to which such deposit shall have been made shall no longer
 be deemed to be outstanding in the hands of such holders, and all rights of
 such holders with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall forthwith
 upon such deposit in trust cease and terminate, except only the right of such
 holders to receive the amount payable upon the redemption thereof, but without
 interest.  All or any shares of the Preferred Stock redeemed at any time may,
 in the discretion of the Board of Directors and to the extent permitted by law,
 be reissued or otherwise disposed of at any time or from time to time subject
 to the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

         (d)  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
 affairs of the Corporation, then before any distribution shall be made to the
 holders of the Common Stock, the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock at
 the time outstanding shall be entitled to be paid in cash, in the case of the
 series of Preferred Stock designated above, the respective amounts hereinbefore
 specified with respect thereto, and, in the case of Preferred Stock of any
 other series, such amount as shall have been fixed by the Board of Directors as
 hereinbefore provided, together with a sum in the case of each such share,
 computed at the annual dividend

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
 rate for the series of which the particular share is a part from the date from
 which dividends on such shares became cumulative to the date fixed for the
 payment of such distributive amounts, less the aggregate of the dividends
 theretofore or on such date paid thereon.  After such payment to the holders of
 the Preferred Stock, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation shall be
 divided and distributed among the holders of the Common Stock then outstanding
 according to their respective shares.

         (e)  Unless and until four quarter-yearly dividends payable on the
 Preferred Stock shall be in default, in whole or in part, every stockholder
 shall have one vote for each share of Preferred Stock, and one vote for each
 share of Common Stock, held by him, on all matters, including the election of
 Directors, except as otherwise provided by law or by these Articles of
 Incorporation, as amended.  If and when four quarter-yearly dividends (whether
 or not consecutive) payable on the Preferred Stock shall be in default, in
 whole or in part, every stockholder shall have one vote for each share of
 Preferred Stock, and one vote for each share of Common Stock, held by him, on
 all matters except the election of Directors, and in such case the number of
 Directors of the Corporation shall thereupon, and until such default shall have
 been remedied, be two more than the number specified in and pursuant to Article
 Fifth of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, the holders of the
 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, shall
 become entitled to elect the two additional members of the Board of Directors,
 and at each annual election of Directors thereafter during the continuance of
 such default the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class,
 shall be entitled to elect two members of the Board of Directors and the
 holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be entitled to
 elect the remaining Directors of the Corporation.  However, if and when all
 dividends then in default on the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
 thereafter be paid (and such dividends shall be declared and paid out of any
 funds legally available therefor as soon as reasonably practicable), the
 Preferred Stock shall thereupon be divested of such special right herein
 provided for to elect such members of the Board of Directors, the voting power
 of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock shall revert to the status existing
 before the occurrence of such default, and the number of Directors of the
 Corporation shall again be the number specified in and pursuant to Article
 Fifth of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended; but always subject to the
 same provisions for vesting such special rights in the Preferred Stock in case
 of any similar future default or defaults.  A meeting of the holders of the
 Preferred Stock, at which the holders of the Preferred Stock shall vote as a
 class, shall be held at any time after the accrual of such special right to
 elect such two additional members of the Board of Directors, upon notice
 similar to that provided in the By-laws for a special meeting, upon call by the
 holders of not less than 1,000 shares of the Preferred Stock or upon call by
 the Secretary of the Corporation at the request in writing of any holder of
 Preferred Stock addressed to him at the principal office of the Corporation.
 Upon termination of such special right at any time by reason of the payment of
 all accumulated and defaulted dividends on such stock, the terms of office of
 all persons who may have been elected Directors of the Corporation by vote of
 the holders of the Preferred Stock, as a class, pursuant to such special right
 shall forthwith terminate.

         Whenever Directors are elected by the stockholders by classes, pursuant
 to this subdivision (e), in case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors,
 through death, resignation,

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
 disqualification or other cause, occurring among the Directors elected by the
 holders of the Common Stock, as a class, the remaining Directors elected by the
 vote of the holders of the Common Stock, as a class, by affirmative vote of the
 majority thereof, may elect a successor to hold office for the unexpired term
 of the Director whose place shall be vacant; and in case of any such vacancy in
 the Board of Directors occurring among the Directors elected by the holders of
 the Preferred Stock, as a class, the holders of the Preferred Stock then
 outstanding and entitled to vote may, at a meeting of such holders called in
 the manner provided by this subdivision (e), elect a successor to hold office
 for the unexpired term of the Director whose place shall be vacant.  In all
 other cases any such vacancy shall be filled by the affirmative vote of the
 majority of the remaining Directors, and the Directors so elected shall hold
 office until their successors shall be elected and qualified.

         (f)  In all elections for Directors, each shareholder shall have the
 right to cast as many votes in the aggregate as shall equal the number of
 voting shares held by him multiplied by the number of Directors to be elected,
 and may cast the whole number of votes, either in person or by proxy, for one
 candidate or distribute such votes among two or more candidates; provided,
 however, that in case the Directors are to be elected by particular classes of
 stock as provided in the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, in the event of
 default in the payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, each holder of the
 particular class of stock shall have the right to cast as many votes in the
 aggregate as shall equal the number of shares of such class held by him
 multiplied by the number of Directors to be elected by such class, and may cast
 the whole number of such votes for one candidate for Director to be elected by
 such class or may distribute such votes among two or more candidates for
 Directors to be elected by such class.

         (g)  Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of
 Incorporation, as amended, the holders of record of a majority of the
 outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at any
 meeting of shareholders, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
 constitute a quorum at such meeting; provided, that in no event shall a quorum
 consist of less than a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, but
 less than such quorum shall have the right successively to adjourn the meeting
 to a specified date not longer than ninety days after such adjournment, without
 notice other than announcement at the meeting.

         (h)  No holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled as such as a matter
 of right to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue
 of stock or securities convertible into stock, of any class whatever, whether
 now or hereafter authorized, and whether issued for cash, property, services or
 otherwise.

         (i)  Upon the issuance for money or other consideration of any shares
 of capital stock of the Corporation or of any securities convertible into
 shares of capital stock of the Corporation, of any class whatever which may be
 authorized from time to time, no holder of shares of Common Stock of the
 Corporation shall be entitled as such as a matter of right to subscribe for,
 purchase or receive any proportionate or other share of the capital stock or
 securities so issued, but all or any portion of such capital stock may be
 disposed of by the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
 Corporation, as and when determined by the Board of Directors, free of any such
 rights, whether by offering the same to shareholders or by sale or other
 disposition as the Board of Directors may deem advisable; provided, however,
 that if the Board of Directors shall determine to issue and sell any shares of
 Common Stock (including, for the purposes of this paragraph, any security
 convertible into Common Stock, but excluding shares of such Common Stock and
 securities convertible into such Common Stock theretofore reacquired by the
 Corporation after having been duly issued, or issued to satisfy any conversion
 or option rights theretofore granted by the Corporation) solely for money and
 other than by:

              (1)  a public offering thereof, or

              (2) an offering thereof to or through underwriters or dealers who
         shall agree promptly to make a public offering thereof, or

              (3) The issue thereof in connection with (a) any dividend
         reinvestment, stock purchase or other plan in which the holders of the
         Common, Preferred or Preference Stock or customers of the Corporation
         or of any subsidiary of the Corporation may participate or (b) any
         stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, stock bonus, savings,
         pension or other plan in connection with which employees or former
         employees (including officers and directors) of the Corporation or any
         subsidiary of the Corporation may purchase or acquire Common Stock (or
         securities of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for
         Common Stock) or any trust related to, or any agent acting with respect
         to, any such plan may purchase or acquire Common Stock (or securities
         of the Corporation convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock)
         on behalf of, or for the account or benefit of, such employees or
         former employees or, in case of any such trust, for the purpose of
         investing the funds of the trust, or

              (4) any other offering thereof which shall have been authorized or
         approved by the affirmative consent (given in writing without a meeting
         or by vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose) of the holders of
         a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding and entitled
         to vote,

 such shares of Common Stock shall first be offered pro rata to the holders of
 record of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding outstanding
 shares of such Common Stock held for the benefit of holders of scrip
 certificates or other instruments representing fractional interests in a full
 share of such Common Stock) upon terms which, in the judgment of the Board of
 Directors, shall be not less favorable (without deduction of such reasonable
 compensation for the sale, underwriting or purchase of such shares by
 underwriters or dealers as may lawfully be paid by the Corporation) to the
 purchaser than the terms upon which such shares are offered to others than such
 holders of the Common Stock; provided that the Corporation shall not be
 obligated to offer or to issue any fractional interest in a full share of
 Common Stock; and provided further that the time within which such preemptive
 rights shall be exercised may be limited to such time as to the Board of
 Directors may seem proper, not less,

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
 however, than fourteen days after the mailing of notice that such preemptive
 rights are available and may be exercised.

         (j)  So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
 amendment to the Articles of Incorporation which would change the express
 preferences, priorities or character of the Preferred Stock or the rate of
 dividend to be paid thereon in any manner substantially prejudicial to the
 holders thereof shall be made, except as hereinafter in subdivisions (k) and
 (n) provided and except an amendment changing the number of the Board of
 Directors, without the affirmative consent (given in writing without a meeting
 or by vote at a meeting duly called for the purpose) of the holders of at least
 three-fourths of the aggregate number of shares of the Preferred Stock then
 outstanding; but such amendment may be made with such affirmative consent,
 together with such additional vote or consent of stockholders as from time to
 time may be required by law.

         (k)  So long as any of the shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding,
 the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative consent (given in writing
 without a meeting or by vote at a meeting duly called for the purpose) of the
 holders of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of shares of the
 Preferred Stock then outstanding:

              (1) sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Preferred Stock
         or of stock of any other class ranking on a parity with or having any
         preference over the Preferred Stock as to assets or dividends, unless
         the net earnings of the Corporation available for the payment of
         dividends on the Preferred Stock and on all such other classes of
         stock, computed in accordance with good accounting practice, for a
         period of any twelve consecutive calendar months within the fifteen
         calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the month in
         which such additional stock is issued are at least two and one-half
         times the annual dividend requirements on all shares of the Preferred
         Stock and of all other classes of stock ranking on a parity with or
         having any preference over the Preferred Stock as to assets or
         dividends, to be outstanding immediately after such proposed additional
         issue; and, in determining such net earnings available for the payment
         of dividends on the Preferred Stock and on all such other classes of
         stock, any dividend received by the Corporation during such period on
         stock of any subsidiary of the Corporation in excess of the net
         earnings of such subsidiary for such period available therefor,
         computed in accordance with good accounting practice, shall be included
         only to the extent of such net earnings of such subsidiary; or

              (2) create any class of stock which shall be preferred as to
         dividends or assets over the Preferred Stock; or

              (3) increase the authorized number of shares of the Preferred
         Stock; or

              (4) reclassify outstanding shares of stock of any class ranking
         junior to the Preferred Stock as to assets or dividends, wholly or
         partially, into shares of stock of

                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
         any class ranking on a parity with or having any preference over the
         Preferred Stock as to assets or dividends; or

              (5) make any distribution out of capital or capital surplus (other
         than dividends payable in stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock
         as to assets and dividends) to holders of stock of the Corporation
         ranking junior to the Preferred Stock as to assets or dividends; or

              (6) issue any shares of the Preferred Stock or any other stock
         ranking on a parity with or having any preference over the Preferred
         Stock as to assets or dividends, if the stated capital to be
         represented by the Preferred Stock and such other stock outstanding
         immediately after such issue would exceed the stated capital to be
         represented by shares of stock to be then outstanding ranking junior to
         the Preferred Stock as to assets and dividends, increased by the amount
         of any capital surplus or reduced by the amount of any deficit.  For
         the purpose of this subdivision (6), stated capital represented by any
         preferred stock having a par value shall be the par value thereof, and
         stated capital represented by any preferred stock without par value
         shall be the amount of stated capital fixed by the Board of Directors
         with respect thereto at the time of issue thereof, or the amount
         payable to the holders thereof (exclusive of accrued and unpaid
         dividends) in preference to the Common Stock upon involuntary
         liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
         Corporation, whichever is greater;

 but any such action requiring such affirmative consent of the holders of the
 Preferred Stock, as provided in this subdivision (k), may be taken with such
 vote or consent of stockholders as may at the time be required by law, but with
 at least the affirmative consent (given in writing without a meeting or by vote
 at a meeting duly called for the purpose) of the holders of two-thirds of the
 aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding.  Stock shall
 not be considered to be outstanding for any of the purposes of this subdivision
 (k) or of subdivision (j) above, if the Board of Directors shall have
 determined to redeem such stock and if the first publication of notice of
 redemption shall have been made, or irrevocable instructions given therefor,
 and all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been deposited in trust
 for such purpose.

         (l)  No amendment to the Articles of Incorporation which would change
 the provisions of the foregoing subdivisions (f), (g) or (i) in any manner
 substantially prejudicial to the holders of any class of stock, shall be made
 without the affirmative consent (given in writing without a meeting or by vote
 at a meeting duly called for such purpose) of the holders of at least two-
 thirds of the aggregate number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
 then outstanding and entitled to vote; but such amendment may be made with such
 affirmative consent, together with such additional vote or consent of
 shareholders as from time to time may be required by law.

         (m)  No amendment to the Articles of Incorporation providing for the
 creation or increase of Preferred Stock of any class shall be made without the
 affirmative consent (given in

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
 
 writing without a meeting or by vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose)
 of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate number of shares of
 Common Stock of the Corporation then outstanding; but such amendment may be
 made with such affirmative consent, together with such additional vote or
 consent of holders of Preferred Stock of the Corporation as shall at the time
 be required by the Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

         (n)  Subject to the provisions of subdivisions (j), (k), (l) and (m)
 hereof, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal,
 to the extent now or hereafter permitted by law, any provision in its Articles
 of Incorporation, as amended, (including the authorizing of preferred stock
 junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends and assets and the changing of
 any authorized but unissued shares of the Preferred Stock to shares of another
 class or classes of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred
 Stock as to assets and dividends but which may have different dividend rates,
 redemption prices and other terms and provisions as may at the time be
 permitted by law) with such vote or consent of stockholders as from time to
 time may be required by law, and all rights herein conferred upon the
 shareholders are granted subject to this reservation.

         (o)  Subject to the provisions of subdivision (k) hereof, the
 Corporation may issue and dispose of its authorized but unissued shares without
 par value, from time to time, for such consideration as may from time to time
 be prescribed by the Board of Directors, and authority is hereby expressly
 conferred on the Board of Directors so to fix such consideration.  The Board of
 Directors is also hereby expressly authorized to determine, at or before the
 time of issue thereof, what part of the consideration which shall be received
 by the Corporation upon the issue from time to time of shares of its capital
 stock without par value shall be capital, and, in the absence of any such
 determination, the entire consideration received for any particular shares
 shall be capital.  Any and all shares without par value issued for the
 consideration so fixed shall be deemed fully paid and be non-assessable, and
 the holder of such shares shall not be liable thereon to the Corporation or its
 creditors.

         (p)  The Preference Stock shall have, or be subject to, as the case may
 be, the following preferences, rights, privileges and restrictions:

         Manner of Issue - Series - The Board of Directors is empowered to cause
 the Preference Stock to be issued from time to time as shares of one or more
 series of Preference Stock, and in the resolution or resolutions providing for
 the issue of each particular series, before issuance, the Board of Directors is
 expressly authorized to fix:

              (1) the distinctive serial designation of the shares of such
         series and the number of shares which shall constitute such series;

              (2) the annual dividend rate for the particular series, the dates
         of payment of dividends on shares of such series and the dates from
         which they are cumulative;

              (3) the redemption price per share and the terms of redemption for
         the shares of a particular series;

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
         (4) the amount or amounts per share (exclusive of accrued and unpaid
         dividends) for the particular series payable to the holders thereof in
         case of dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
         Corporation;

              (5) the terms and conditions, if any, upon which shares of the
         particular series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for,
         shares of any stock of junior rank, with respect to dividends and
         assets, including the price or prices or the rate or rates of
         conversion or exchange and the terms of adjustment thereof, if any;

              (6) the terms and amount of any sinking fund created for the
         purchase or redemption of the shares of any particular series; and

              (7) any other characteristics of, and any restrictive or other
         provisions relating to, the shares of each particular series not
         inconsistent with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, as
         amended, as the Board of Directors may by law be permitted to fix.

 All shares of Preference Stock shall be of junior rank, with respect to
 dividends and assets, to all shares of Preferred Stock and of senior rank in
 such respects to all shares of Common Stock.  All shares of Preference Stock of
 any one series shall be identical with each other in all respects except, in
 the event portions of the shares of a single series are issued at different
 times, the date from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative; and all
 shares of all series shall be of equal rank as to dividends and assets with
 each other, regardless of series, and shall be identical with each other in all
 respects except as hereinabove provided.

         Dividends - Dividends on Preference Stock of any series shall be
 payable at annual rates and on dates fixed by the Board of Directors at the
 time of the creation of such series, payable quarter-yearly on such dates as
 shall be fixed for such payments by the Board of Directors.  The right of
 holders of Preference Stock to receive dividends shall be subject to the
 dividend and sinking fund provisions of the Preferred Stock.  Dividends on the
 Preference Stock shall be cumulative, and no dividends shall be declared or
 paid, or any distribution made, on Common Stock, other than a dividend payable
 in Common Stock, unless and until full dividends on the outstanding Preference
 Stock shall have been paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
 thereof set aside, with respect to all past dividend periods and the current
 dividend period.  Dividends on shares of any series of Preference Stock shall
 accrue from and be cumulative from such date as may be fixed by the Board of
 Directors at the time of the creation of such series, except that dividends on
 shares of Preference Stock of any series, which are issued after the initial
 issue of shares of such series, shall accrue from and be cumulative from such
 date as may be fixed by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance of such
 additional shares.

         Redemption - If so provided by the Board of Directors upon the creation
 of any series of Preference Stock, the Corporation, at the option of the Board
 of Directors, or in accordance with the requirements of any sinking fund for
 the Preference Stock or any series thereof, may redeem the whole or any part of
 the Preference Stock at any time outstanding, or

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
 the whole or any part of any series thereof, at such time or times and from
 time to time as may be determined by the Board of Directors and at such
 redemption price or prices as may have been fixed by the Board of Directors at
 the time of the creation of the shares so to be redeemed, together with an
 amount equal to all unpaid dividends accrued thereon to the date fixed for such
 redemption, and otherwise upon the terms and conditions fixed by the Board of
 Directors for any such redemption; provided, however, that no redemption of any
 Preference Stock shall be effected unless (1) full dividends on all outstanding
 shares of Preferred Stock and Preference Stock for all past dividend periods
 shall have been paid, or declared and a sufficient sum set apart for the
 payment thereof, and (2) all obligations of the Corporation, if any, with
 respect to the redemption or purchase of shares of Preferred Stock and
 Preference Stock in accordance with the requirements of any sinking fund have
 been met.

         Liquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up of the Affairs of the
 Corporation - In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
 affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, but only after
 full payment has been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of all amounts
 to which they are entitled by these Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or a
 sufficient sum set apart for such payment, the holders of shares of each series
 of Preference Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive out of the
 assets of the Corporation, before any distribution or payment shall be made to
 the holders of the Common Stock, the amount fixed by the Board of Directors in
 creating such series, plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends accrued
 thereon to the date fixed for such payment to the holders of Preference Stock.

         Voting Rights - Except as otherwise provided in these Articles of
 Incorporation, as amended, each holder of Preference Stock shall be entitled at
 all meetings of shareholders of the Corporation to one vote for each share of
 such stock held by him; and the holders of Preference Stock shall vote together
 with the holders of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock as a single class,
 except in those instances where these Articles of Incorporation, as amended,
 grant to the holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock the right to vote as a
 separate class.  The voting rights of the holders of Preference Stock in an
 election of directors shall be identical with the voting rights of the holders
 of Common Stock in such election, as set forth in these Articles of
 Incorporation, as amended, and the provision for filling vacancies in the Board
 of Directors that are by said amended Articles applicable to holders of the
 Common Stock shall be equally applicable to holders of the Preference Stock.

         Whenever four quarter-yearly dividends payable on the Preference Stock
 shall be in default, and during the continuance of such default, the Common
 Stock and the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be
 entitled to elect the same number of directors as was authorized by the
 Articles of Incorporation immediately prior to such default, and the Preference
 Stock, as a class, shall be entitled to elect two additional directors.

         Notwithstanding any other provision in those Articles of Incorporation,
 as amended, the affirmative approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of
 the Preference Stock of all series thereof then outstanding present and voting
 at a meeting, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be
 required for any amendment of these Articles of Incorporation, as

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
 amended, altering adversely any existing provision of the Preference Stock or
 for an increase in the authorized amount of the Preference Stock or the
 creation, or an increase in the authorized amount of any class of stock
 ranking, as to dividends and assets, on a parity with or prior to the
 Preference Stock.

         Preemptive Rights - No holder of shares of any series of the Preference
 Stock shall, as such, have any preemptive or preferential right to subscribe to
 or purchase shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation, now or
 hereafter authorized, or any securities convertible into, or warrants or other
 evidences of optional rights to purchase, or subscribe to, shares of any class
 or series of stock of the Corporation, now or hereafter authorized.

        follows:


                                   ARTICLE I.

                          DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW BONDS

           SECTION 1.  There is hereby created a new series of Bonds to be
        executed, authenticated and delivered under and secured by the Original
        Indenture which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 1 of Article
        II of the Original Indenture, be designated as "First Mortgage Bonds, 6
        3/4% Series due 2008" (the "New Bonds") of the Company.  The New Bonds
        shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the
        provisions of, and shall in all respects be subject to all of the terms,
        conditions and covenants of, the Original Indenture.

           The New Bonds shall mature May 1, 2008, and shall bear interest at
        the rate per annum set forth in the form of the New Bond contained in
        Section 3 of this Article I, payable semi-annually on the first day of
        May and the first day of November in each year.  The New Bonds shall be
        payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest in any coin or
        currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is
        legal tender for public and private debts, and shall be payable at the
        office of the Company in the City of St. Louis, Missouri; provided,
        however, that at the option of the Company, interest on the New Bonds
        may be paid by checks mailed to the registered holder in whose name such
        Bonds are registered at the address as it shall appear on the transfer
        register of the Company.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
           SECTION 2.  The New Bonds shall be registered Bonds without coupons,
        of the denomination of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

           The New Bonds shall be transferable and exchangeable for the New
        Bonds of other denominations, as in the Original Indenture provided,
        except that payment of a service charge therefor will not be required by
        the Company.

           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 of Article II of the
        Original Indenture, the New Bonds shall be dated the date of
        authentication and shall bear interest from the interest payment date to
        which interest on the New Bonds has been paid next preceding the date
        thereof, unless such date is an interest payment date to which interest
        has been paid, in which case they shall bear interest from the date
        thereof, or unless the date thereof is prior to November 1, 1993, in
        which case they shall bear interest from May 1, 1993; provided, however,
        that, subject to the provisions of this Section with respect to failure
        by the Company to pay any interest on an interest payment date, the
        holder of any New Bond dated after a record date (as hereinafter
        defined) for the payment of interest and prior to the date of payment of
        such interest shall not be entitled to payment of such interest and
        shall have no claim against the Company with respect thereto.

           The person in whose name any New Bond is registered at the close of
        business on any record date with respect to any interest payment date
        shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such interest
        payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Bond upon any
        transfer or exchange thereof subsequent to the record date and prior to
        such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Company
        shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest
        payment date, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the
        person in whose name such Bond is registered on the date of payment of
        such defaulted interest or on a subsequent record date for such payment
        if one shall have been established as hereinafter provided.  A
        subsequent record date may be established by the Company by notice
        mailed to the holders of the New Bonds not less than ten days preceding
        such record date, which record date shall be not more than thirty days
        prior to the subsequent interest payment date.  The term "record date"
        as used in this Section with respect to any regular interest payment
        date shall mean the April 15 or October 15, as the case may be, next
        preceding such interest payment date, or, if such April 15 or October 15
        shall be a legal holiday in the State of New York or in the State of
        Missouri or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough of
        Manhattan, The City of New York, or the City of St. Louis, Missouri, are
        authorized by law to close, the next preceding day which shall not be a
        legal holiday or a day on which such institutions are so authorized to
        close.

           SECTION 3.  The New Bonds and the Trustee's certificate on the New
        Bonds shall be substantially in the following forms respectively:

           This Bond is one of the Bonds, of the series designated therein,
        described in the within-mentioned Amended Indenture and Supplemental
        Indenture of May 1, 1993.

                                    Boatmen's Trust Company,
                                    Trustee.

        By Union Electric Company, Agent

                         [form of reverse of new bond]

           This Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company
        (herein called the "Bonds"), in unlimited aggregate principal amount, of
        the series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under and
        equally secured by indenture of mortgage and deed of trust, dated June
        15, 1937, executed by the Company to Boatmen's Trust Company, (herein
        called the "Trustee"), as trustee, as amended by indentures supplemental
        thereto dated May 1, 1941, April 1,

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
 
        1971, February 1, 1974, and July 7, 1980, between the Company and the
        Trustee (said mortgage and deed of trust, as so amended, being herein
        called the "Amended Indenture"), to which Amended Indenture and all
        indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
        description of the properties mortgaged and pledged, the nature and
        extent of the security, the rights of the bearers or registered owners
        of the Bonds and of the Trustee in respect thereto, and the terms and
        conditions upon which the Bonds are, and are to be, secured.  To the
        extent permitted by, and as provided in, the Amended Indenture,
        modifications or alterations of the Amended Indenture, or of any
        indenture supplemental thereto, and of the rights and obligations of the
        Company and of the holders of the Bonds may be made with the consent of
        the Company by an affirmative vote of not less than 80% in amount of the
        Bonds entitled to vote then outstanding, at a meeting of Bondholders
        called and held as provided in the Amended Indenture, and by an
        affirmative vote of not less than 80% in amount of the Bonds of any
        series entitled to vote then outstanding and affected by such
        modification or alteration, in case one or more but less than all of the
        series of Bonds then outstanding under the Amended Indenture are so
        affected.  The Company has reserved the right to amend the Amended
        Indenture without any consent or other action by holders of bonds of any
        series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16, 1976, or by
        any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including the Supplemental
        Indenture of May 1, 1993, to provide that the Amended Indenture may be
        modified or altered with the consent of the holders of not less than 60%
        in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and if less than all series
        of Bonds are affected with the consent also of the holders of not less
        than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds of each series so
        affected.  Additionally, the Company has reserved the right to amend the
        Amended Indenture, as supplemented, to authorize amendments thereto by
        an appropriate written consent of not less than 60% in aggregate
        principal amount of the Bonds outstanding without a meeting of such
        Bondholders.  No such modification or alteration shall be made which
        will affect the terms of payment of the principal of, or interest or
        premium on, this Bond, which are unconditional.  The Bonds may be issued
        in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different times,
        may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as in the
        Amended Indenture provided.  This Bond is one of a series designated as
        the "First Mortgage Bonds, 6 3/4% Series due 2008" (herein called the
        "Bonds of this Series") of the Company, issued under and secured by the
        Amended Indenture and described in the indenture (hereinafter called the
        "New Supplemental Indenture") dated May 1, 1993, between the Company and
        the Trustee, supplemental to the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are not entitled to the benefit of any
        improvement, maintenance or analogous fund.

           The Bonds of this Series are not subject to redemption prior to
        maturity.

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
           In case an event of default, as defined in the Amended Indenture,
        shall occur, the principal of all the Bonds at any such time outstanding
        under the Amended Indenture may be declared or may become due and
        payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect
        provided in the Amended Indenture.  The Amended Indenture provides that
        such declaration may in certain events be waived by the holders of a
        majority in principal amount of the Bonds outstanding.

           This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof, in person
        or by duly authorized attorney, on the books of the Company to be kept
        for that purpose at the office of the Company in the City of St. Louis,
        Missouri, upon surrender and cancellation of this Bond and on
        presentation of a duly executed written instrument of transfer, and
        thereupon a new Bond or Bonds of the same series, of the same aggregate
        principal amount and in authorized denominations will be issued to the
        transferee or transferees in exchange herefor, without payment of any
        charge other than stamp taxes and other governmental charges incident
        thereto; and this Bond with or without others of like series, may in
        like manner be exchanged for one or more new Bonds of the same series of
        other authorized denominations but of the same aggregate principal
        amount; all subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended
        Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are to be issued initially under a book-
        entry only system and, except as hereinafter provided, will be
        registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New
        York ("DTC") or its nominee, which shall be considered to be the holder
        of all of the Bonds of this Series for all purposes of the Mortgage,
        including, without limitation, payment by the Company of principal of
        and interest on such Bonds of this Series and receipt of notices and
        exercise of rights of holders of such Bonds of this Series.  There shall
        be a single global bond of this series which shall be immobilized in the
        custody of DTC or its designee with the owners of book-entry interest in
        Bonds of this Series ("Book-Entry Interests") having no right to receive
        Bonds of this Series in the form of physical securities or certificates.
        Ownership of Book-Entry Interests shall be shown by book-entry on the
        system maintained and operated by DTC, its participants (the
        "Participants") and certain persons acting through the Participants.
        Transfers of ownership of Book-Entry Interests are to be made only by
        DTC and the Participants by that book-entry system, the Company and the
        Trustee having no responsibility therefor so long as Bonds of this
        Series are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee.  DTC is to
        maintain records of the positions of Participants in Bonds of this
        Series, and the Participants and persons acting through Participants are
        to maintain records of the purchasers and owners of Book-Entry
        Interests.  If DTC or its nominee determines not to continue to act as a
        depository for the Bonds of this Series in connection with a book-entry
        only system, another depository, if available, may act instead and the
        single global bond of this series will be transferred into the name of
        such other depository or its nominee, in which case the above provisions

        Book-Entry Interests in principal amounts coinciding with the amounts of
        such Book-Entry Interests shown on the book-entry system immediately
        prior to the discontinuance thereof.  Neither the Trustee nor the
        Company shall be responsible for the accuracy of the interests shown on
        that system.

           No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of,

        thereto, against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, director
        or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any
        predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the
        Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether for
        amounts unpaid on stock subscriptions or by virtue of any constitution,

        stockholders, directors or officers being released by every owner hereof
        by the acceptance of this Bond and as part of the consideration for the
        issue hereof, and being likewise released by the terms of the Amended

        required to be paid into the trust estate or to satisfy the maintenance
        and improvement funds under any provision of the Original Indenture or
        the Supplemental Indentures creating prior series of Bonds, on the basis
        of the amount of $15,000,000 excluded from net bondable value of
        property additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to
        Section 3 of Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 1945,

        issue and the same series, if any, and of the same maturity), except
        upon compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of Article IV of the
        Original Indenture, nor unless the net earnings of the Company available
        for interest after property retirement appropriations (determined as

        charges on the indebtedness specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of
        paragraph (1) of Section 2(a) of said Article V; provided that, if the
        application for the issue of such additional prior lien bonds is upon
        the basis of payment at maturity of prior lien bonds theretofore sold or
        otherwise disposed of or the redemption or purchase thereof after a date
        two years prior to the date of maturity, the additional requirement
        imposed by this Section 4 with respect to net earnings of the Company

        include, in addition to the matters otherwise required to be stated

        unfunded prior lien or prior liens, except upon compliance with the
        provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the Original Indenture, nor
        unless the net earnings of such property available for interest after
        property retirement appropriations (determined in the manner provided in

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
 
        July 1, 1956), for any twelve consecutive calendar months during the
        period of fifteen calendar months immediately preceding the first day of
        the month in which the first acquisition of property subject to such
        lien or liens occurs, have been, in the aggregate, equal to not less
        than twice the amount of annual interest charges, on all outstanding
        indebtedness secured by such lien or liens.  Any officers' certificate
        with respect to net earnings of such property, required to be filed with
        the Trustee as a condition precedent to the acquisition of such
        property, shall include, in addition to the matters otherwise required
        to be stated therein, the matters required to be stated in an officers'
        certificate pursuant to Section 2 of said Article V applicable, however,
        only to the net earnings of such property and to the indebtedness
        secured by such liens to which such property is subject.

           The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or
        in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture
        or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the
        recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made by the Company

              (A)  When the provisions of this Article VI shall become effective
           as provided in Subdivision (B) hereof, the provisions of the Original
           Indenture shall become and shall be deemed to have been, amended,

<PAGE>
 
           (1) by inserting the following paragraph after the definition of
        "Nonbondable property" in Article I of the Original Indenture;

           "Nuclear fuel:

              The term 'Nuclear fuel' shall mean (a) any fuel element, including
           nuclear fuel and associated means (and any similar or analogous

           or not chargeable to operating expenses, comprising or intended to
           comprise or formerly comprising the core, or other part of a nuclear
           reactor or any similar or analogous device, (b) any fuel element,
           including nuclear fuel and associated means (and any similar or

           material, or as potential fuel material, in a nuclear reactor or any
           similar or analogous device."

           (2)  by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (e) of the
        definition of "Permitted liens" in Article I of the Original Indenture,
        changing the period at the end of subparagraph (f) of such definition to

              "(g) any controls, liens, restrictions, regulations, easements,
           exceptions or reservations of any governmental authority applying
           particularly to 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (3) by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (d) of the
        third paragraph of the definition of "Property additions" in Article I
        of the Original Indenture, changing the period at the end of
        subparagraph (e) to "; and" and adding a new subparagraph (f) reading as
        follows:

              "(f) anything in this Indenture notwithstanding, the term
           'Property additions' shall include 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (4) by inserting after the words "such property additions" when first
        used in subdivision (4) of subparagraph (f) of Section 4 of Article III
        of the Original Indenture the following:

                ", provided that, in the case of property additions constituting
              all or part of a facility for the production of electricity by use
              of a nuclear reactor or any similar or analogous device, or
              Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components for use therein,
              in respect of which the

<PAGE>
 
              application is made prior to receipt of necessary authority to
              operate such facility, such opinion need only state that (i) the
              Company has necessary authority to own such property additions and
              (ii) in the case of property additions for which construction
              authority is necessary, the Company has necessary authority to
              construct the same."

        and

           (5) by inserting after the words "any machinery or equipment," in
        subparagraph (a) of Section 2 of Article VII of the Original Indenture
        the following:

              "or any Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components,"

              (B)  The provisions of this Article VI shall become effective on
           the earliest date on which either (a) no Bonds of a Series prior to
           the Bonds of 2004 Series (as described in the Supplemental Indenture
           dated February 1, 1974) shall be outstanding or (b) the amendment to
           the Original Indenture provided in Article VII of the Supplemental
           Indenture dated February 1, 1974, shall have become effective upon
           vote of the holders of Bonds as provided in Article XV of the
           Original Indenture, provided that no vote of the holders of the Bonds
           of 2004 Series or Bonds of any series created thereafter shall be
           required for effecting such amendments.



                                  ARTICLE VII.

                           RESERVATIONS BY COMPANY TO
                           AMEND ORIGINAL INDENTURE.

           SECTION 1.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof so as to substitute "sixty percent. (60%)" for
        "eighty percent. (80%)" wherever appearing in said Article XV.

           SECTION 2.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate

        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall

                                      -22-
<PAGE>
 
        be necessary in order to amend Article XV thereof by adding thereto a
        Section 9 to read as follows:

               "SECTION 9.  (A)  Anything in this Article XV contained to the
             contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent (in any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
             Bondholders or by their attorneys appointed in writing) of the
             holders of sixty percent. (60%) or more in principal amount of the
             Bonds outstanding hereunder, and, if the rights of one or more, but
             less than all, series of Bonds then outstanding are to be affected
             by action taken pursuant to such consent, then also by consent of
             the holders of at least sixty per cent. (60%) in principal amount
             of each  series of Bonds so to be affected and outstanding
             hereunder (at the time the last such needed consent is delivered to
             the Trustee) in lieu of the holding of a meeting pursuant to this
             Article XV and in lieu of all action at such a meeting and with the
             same force and effect as a resolution duly adopted in accordance
             with the provisions of Section 6 of this Article XV.

              (B)  Instruments of consent shall be witnessed or in the
           alternative may (a) have the signature guaranteed by a bank or trust
           company or a registered dealer in securities, (b) be acknowledged
           before a Notary Public or other officer authorized to take
           acknowledgements, or (c) have their genuineness otherwise established
           to the satisfaction of the Trustee.

              The amount of Bonds payable to bearer, and the series and serial
           numbers thereof, held by a person executing an instrument of consent
           (or whose attorney has executed an instrument of consent in his
           behalf), and the date of his holding the same may be proved by
           exhibiting the Bonds to and obtaining a certificate executed by (i)
           any bank or trust or insurance company, or (ii) any trustee,
           secretary, administrator or other proper officer of any pension,
           welfare, hospitalization or similar fund or funds, or (iii) the
           United States of America, any Territory thereof, the District of
           Columbia, any State of the United States or any public
           instrumentality of the United States, or of any State or of any
           Territory, or (iv) any other person or corporation satisfactory to
           the Trustee.  A Bondholder in any of the foregoing categories may
           sign a certificate in his own behalf.

              Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state, in effect,
           that as of the date thereof, a coupon Bond or Bonds bearing a
           specified serial number or numbers was deposited with or exhibited to
           the signer of such certificate.  The holding by the person named in
           any such certificate of any Bond specified therein shall be presumed
           to continue unless (1) any certificate bearing a later date issued in
           respect of the same Bond shall be produced, (2)  the Bond specified
           in such certificate (or any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or
           substitution for such Bond) shall be produced by another holder, or
           (3) the Bond specified in such certificate shall be registered as to
           principal in the name of another holder or shall have been
           surrendered in exchange for

                                      -23-
<PAGE>
 
           a fully registered bond registered in the name of another holder.
           The Trustee may nevertheless, in his discretion, require further
           proof in cases where it deems further proof desirable.  The ownership
           of registered Bonds shall be proved by the registry books.

              (C)  Until such time as the Trustee shall receive the written
           consent of the necessary per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds
           required by the provisions of subsection (A) above for action
           contemplated by such consent, any holder of a Bond, the serial number
           of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Bonds the
           holders of which have consented to such action, may, by filing
           written notice with the Trustee at its principal office and upon
           proof of holding as provided in subsection (B) above, revoke such
           consent so far as it concerns such Bond.  Except as aforesaid, any
           such action taken by the holder of any Bond shall be conclusive and
           binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of such Bond
           (and any Bond issued in lieu thereof or exchanged therefor),
           irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent is made
           upon such Bond, and in any event any action taken by the holders of
           the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds specified
           in subsection (A) above in connection with such action shall be
           conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of
           all the Bonds."

                                   ARTICLE I.

                          DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW BONDS

           SECTION 1.  There is hereby created a new series of Bonds to be
        executed, authenticated and delivered under and secured by the Original
        Indenture which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 1 of Article
        II of the Original Indenture, be designated as "First Mortgage Bonds,
        7.15% Series due 2023" (the "New Bonds") of the Company.  The New Bonds
        shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the
        provisions of, and shall in all respects be subject to all of the terms,
        conditions and covenants of, the Original Indenture.

           The New Bonds shall mature August 1, 2023, and shall bear interest at
        the rate per annum set forth in the form of the New Bond contained in
        Section 3 of

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
        this Article I, payable semi-annually on the first day of February and
        the first day of August in each year.  The New Bonds shall be payable as
        to principal, premium, if any, and interest in any coin or currency of
        the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal
        tender for public and private debts, and shall be payable at the office
        of the Company in the City of St. Louis, Missouri; provided, however,
        that at the option of the Company, interest on the New Bonds may be paid
        by checks mailed to the registered holder in whose name such Bonds are
        registered at the address as it shall appear on the transfer register of
        the Company.

           SECTION 2.  The New Bonds shall be registered Bonds without coupons,
        of the denomination of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

           The New Bonds shall be transferable and exchangeable for the New
        Bonds of other denominations, as in the Original Indenture provided,
        except that payment of a service charge therefor will not be required by
        the Company.

           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 of Article II of the
        Original Indenture, the New Bonds shall be dated the date of
        authentication and shall bear interest from the interest payment date to
        which interest on the New Bonds has been paid next preceding the date
        thereof, unless such date is an interest payment date to which interest
        has been paid, in which case they shall bear interest from the date
        thereof, or unless the date thereof is prior to February 1, 1994, in
        which case they shall bear interest from August 1, 1993; provided,
        however, that, subject to the provisions of this Section with respect to
        failure by the Company to pay any interest on an interest payment date,
        the holder of any New Bond dated after a record date (as hereinafter
        defined) for the payment of interest and prior to the date of payment of
        such interest shall not be entitled to payment of such interest and
        shall have no claim against the Company with respect thereto.

           The person in whose name any New Bond is registered at the close of
        business on any record date with respect to any interest payment date
        shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such interest
        payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Bond upon any
        transfer or exchange thereof subsequent to the record date and prior to
        such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Company
        shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest
        payment date, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the
        person in whose name such Bond is registered on the date of payment of
        such defaulted interest or on a subsequent record date for such payment
        if one shall have been established as hereinafter provided.  A
        subsequent record date may be established by the Company by notice
        mailed to the holders of the New Bonds not less than ten days preceding
        such record date, which record date shall be not more than thirty days
        prior to the subsequent interest payment date.  The term "record date"
        as used in this Section with respect to any regular interest payment
        date shall mean the January 15 or July 15, as the case may be, next
        preceding such interest payment date, or, if such January 15 or

                                      -12-

        July 15 shall be a legal holiday in the State of New York or in the
        State of Missouri or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough
        of Manhattan, The City of New York, or the City of St. Louis, Missouri,
        are authorized by law to close, the next preceding day which shall not
        be a legal holiday or a day on which such institutions are so authorized
        to close.

           SECTION 3.  The New Bonds and the Trustee's certificate on the New
        Bonds shall be substantially in the following forms respectively:

        payment of the principal hereof, until the Company's obligation with
        respect to the payment of such principal shall be discharged as provided
        in the Amended Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.  Such
        interest shall be payable from the February 1 or August 1, as the case
        may be, next preceding the date hereof to which interest has not been
        paid, unless the date hereof is a February 1 or August 1 to which
        interest has been paid, in which case from the date hereof, or unless
        the date hereof is prior to the first payment of interest, in which case
        from August 1, 1993.  The interest so payable will be paid to the person
        in whose name this Bond, or the Bond in exchange or substitution for

        Company, interest on this Bond may be paid by check mailed to the
        registered holder of this Bond at such holder's address as it shall
        appear on the books of the Company to be kept for that purpose.

           This Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Amended
        Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or
        obligatory for any purpose, until Boatmen's Trust Company, the Trustee
        under the Amended Indenture, or a successor trustee thereto under the
        Amended Indenture, or an agent therefor, shall have signed the form of
        certificate endorsed hereon.

           The provisions of this Bond are continued on the reverse hereof and

        thereto dated May 1, 1941, April 1, 1971, February 1, 1974, and July 7,
        1980, between the Company and the Trustee (said mortgage and deed of
        trust, as so amended, being herein called the "Amended Indenture"), to
        which Amended Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
        reference is hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged
        and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of the
        bearers or registered owners of the Bonds and of the Trustee in respect
        thereto, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are, and are
        to be, secured.  To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the
        Amended Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Amended
        Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental thereto, and of the rights
        and obligations of the Company and of the holders of the Bonds may be
        made with the consent of the Company by an affirmative vote of not less
        than 80% in amount of the Bonds entitled to vote then outstanding, at a
        meeting of Bondholders called and held as provided in the Amended
        Indenture, and by an affirmative vote of not less than 80% in amount of
        the Bonds of any series entitled to vote then outstanding and affected
        by such modification or alteration, in case one or more but less than
        all of the series of Bonds then outstanding under the Amended Indenture
        are so affected.  The Company has reserved the right to amend the
        Amended Indenture without any consent or other action by holders of
        bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including the
        Supplemental Indenture of August 1, 1993, to provide that the Amended
        Indenture may be modified or altered with the consent of the holders of
        not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and if
        less than all series of Bonds are affected with the consent also of the
        holders of not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
        of each series so affected.  Additionally, the Company has reserved the
        right to amend the Amended Indenture, as supplemented, to authorize
        amendments thereto by an appropriate written consent of not less than
        60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding without a
        meeting of such Bondholders.  No such modification or alteration shall
        be made which will affect the terms of payment of the principal of, or
        interest or premium on, this Bond, which are unconditional.  The Bonds
        may be issued in series, for various principal sums, may mature at
        different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise
        vary as in the Amended Indenture provided.  This Bond is one of a series
        designated as the "First Mortgage Bonds, 7.15% Series due 2023" (herein
        called the "Bonds of this Series") of the Company, issued under and
        secured by the Amended Indenture and described in the indenture
        (hereinafter called the

                                      -15-

        "New Supplemental Indenture") dated August 1, 1993, between the Company
        and the Trustee, supplemental to the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are not entitled to the benefit of any
        improvement, maintenance or analogous fund.

           The Bonds of this Series will be redeemable at the option of the
        Company, in whole or in part, at any time, upon the payment of
        redemption prices applicable to the respective periods set forth below;
        provided, however, that none of such Bonds shall be redeemed prior to
        August 1, 2003.

        in each case, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for
        redemption.

           Such redemption in every case shall be effected upon notice sent by
        the Company to the registered owner hereof, postage prepaid, at least
        thirty and not more than sixty days prior to the date of redemption, all
        subject to the conditions of, and as more fully set forth in, the
        Amended Indenture and the New Supplemental Indenture.

           In case an event of default, as defined in the Amended Indenture,
        shall occur, the principal of all the Bonds at any such time outstanding
        under the Amended Indenture may be declared or may become due and
        payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect
        provided in the Amended Indenture.  The Amended Indenture provides that
        such declaration may in certain events be waived by the holders of a
        majority in principal amount of the Bonds outstanding.

           This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof, in person
        or by duly authorized attorney, on the books of the Company to be kept
        for that purpose at the office of the Company in the City of St. Louis,
        Missouri, upon surrender and cancellation of this Bond and on
        presentation of a duly executed written instrument of transfer, and
        thereupon a new Bond or Bonds of the same series, of the same aggregate
        principal amount and in authorized denominations will be issued to the
        transferee or transferees in exchange herefor, without

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
        payment of any charge other than stamp taxes and other governmental
        charges incident thereto; and this Bond with or without others of like
        series, may in like manner be exchanged for one or more new Bonds of the
        same series of other authorized denominations but of the same aggregate
        principal amount; all subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
        the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are to be issued initially under a book-
        entry only system and, except as hereinafter provided, will be
        registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New
        York ("DTC") or its nominee, which shall be considered to be the holder
        of all of the Bonds of this Series for all purposes of the Mortgage,
        including, without limitation, payment by the Company of principal of
        and interest on such Bonds of this Series and receipt of notices and
        exercise of rights of holders of such Bonds of this Series.  There shall
        be a single global bond of this series which shall be immobilized in the
        custody of DTC or its designee with the owners of book-entry interest in
        Bonds of this Series ("Book-Entry Interests") having no right to receive
        Bonds of this Series in the form of physical securities or certificates.
        Ownership of Book-Entry Interests shall be shown by book-entry on the
        system maintained and operated by DTC, its participants (the
        "Participants") and certain persons acting through the Participants.
        Transfers of ownership of Book-Entry Interests are to be made only by
        DTC and the Participants by that book-entry system, the Company and the
        Trustee having no responsibility therefor so long as Bonds of this
        Series are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee.  DTC is to
        maintain records of the positions of Participants in Bonds of this
        Series, and the Participants and persons acting through Participants are
        to maintain records of the purchasers and owners of Book-Entry
        Interests.  If DTC or its nominee determines not to continue to act as a
        depository for the Bonds of this Series in connection with a book-entry
        only system, another depository, if available, may act instead and the
        single global bond of this series will be transferred into the name of
        such other depository or its nominee, in which case the above provisions
        will continue to apply but to the new depository.  If the book-entry
        only system for Bonds of this Series is discontinued by the Company for
        any reason, upon surrender and cancellation of the single global bond of
        this series registered in the name of the then depository or its
        nominee, new registered Bonds of this Series will be issued in
        authorized denominations to the holders of Book-Entry Interests in
        principal amounts coinciding with the amounts of such Book-Entry
        Interests shown on the book-entry system immediately prior to the
        discontinuance thereof.  Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall be
        responsible for the accuracy of the interests shown on that system.

           No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of,
        premium, if any, on or the interest on, this Bond, or for any claim
        based hereon or on the Amended Indenture or any indenture supplemental
        thereto, against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, director
        or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any
        predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the
        Company or any such predecessor or successor

        corporation, whether for amounts unpaid on stock subscriptions or by
        virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the
        enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such
        liability, whether at common law, in equity, by any constitution,
        statute or otherwise, of incorporators, stockholders, directors or
        officers being released by every owner hereof by the acceptance of this
        Bond and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, and being
        likewise released by the terms of the Amended Indenture.

           SECTION 4.  Until New Bonds in definitive form are ready for
        delivery, the Company may execute, and upon its request in writing the
        Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu thereof, New Bonds in
        temporary form, as provided in Section 9 of Article II of the Original
        Indenture.  New Bonds in temporary form may, in lieu of the specific
        redemption prices, if any, required to be set forth in New Bonds in
        definitive form, include a reference to this Supplemental Indenture for
        a statement of such redemption prices.



                                  ARTICLE II.

                             ISSUE oF THE NEW BONDS

           SECTION 1.  The principal amount of the New Bonds which may be
        authenticated and delivered hereunder are not limited except as the
        Original Indenture limits the principal amount of Bonds which may be
        issued thereunder.

           SECTION 2.  The New Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of
        Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000), being the initial issue of
        the New Bonds, may forthwith at any time or from time to time be
        executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee and shall be
        authenticated by the Trustee and delivered (either before or after the
        filing or recording hereof) to or upon the order of the Company, upon
        compliance by the Company with the applicable provisions of Article III
        and Article XVIII of the Original Indenture.

                          REDEMPTION OF THE NEW BONDS

           SECTION 1.  The New Bonds shall, subject to the provisions of Article
        V of the Original Indenture, be redeemable at any time or from time to
        time prior to maturity, at the option of the Board of Directors of the
        Company or pursuant to Section 8 of Article VIII of the Original
        Indenture, either as a whole or in part, at the then applicable
        redemption price set forth in the form of New Bonds in Section 3 of
        Article I of this Supplemental Indenture, together, in each case, with
        accrued interest to the redemption date.

           In case of the redemption of less than all the outstanding New Bonds,
        the particular New Bonds or portions (equal to $1,000 or an integral
        multiple thereof) of the New Bonds of a denomination larger than $1,000
        to be redeemed shall be determined by lot in such manner as the Trustee
        in its discretion shall deem proper, as in the Original Indenture
        provided.

           Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 1, the New Bonds shall
        not be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to
        August 1, 2003.

           There shall be no improvement, maintenance or analogous fund for the
        New Bonds.

           SECTION 2.  Subject to the provisions of Article V of the Original
        Indenture, notice of redemption shall be delivered by the Company at
        least thirty and not more than sixty days prior to the date of
        redemption, to the registered owners of the New Bonds to be redeemed at
        their addresses as they appear on the transfer register of the Company,
        except that failure to so mail a notice shall not affect the validity of
        the proceedings for redemption of any other New Bonds.



                                  ARTICLE IV.

                                   COVENANTS.

           The Company hereby covenants, warrants and agrees;

           SECTION 1.  That the Company is lawfully seized and possessed of all
        of the mortgaged property described in the granting clauses of this
        Supplemental Indenture; that it has good right and lawful authority to
        mortgage the same as provided in this Supplemental Indenture; and that
        such mortgaged property is, at

                                      -19-

        the actual date of the issue of the New Bonds, free and clear of any
        deed of trust, mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or
        affecting the title thereto prior to the Original Indenture, except as
        set forth in the granting clauses of the Original Indenture or this
        Supplemental Indenture.

           SECTION 2.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        whenever any officers' certificate is required to be filed or deposited
        with the Trustee pursuant to Section 3(b) of Article III of the Original
        Indenture upon an application for the authentication of additional Bonds
        pursuant to Article III of the Original Indenture, such officers'
        certificate shall include, in addition to the matters required to be
        stated therein by said Section 3(b), the statement with respect to the
        net earnings of the Company available for interest after property
        retirement appropriations required by Section 2 of Article V of the
        Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 3.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not apply for the authentication and delivery of
        additional Bonds pursuant to Section 4 of Article III of the Original
        Indenture or the withdrawal of cash from the trust estate or the
        reduction of the amount of cash required to be paid into the trust
        estate or to satisfy the maintenance and improvement funds under any
        provision of the Original Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures
        creating prior series of Bonds, on the basis of the amount of
        $15,000,000 excluded from net bondable value of property additions not
        subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of Article V of
        the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 1945, or on the basis of the
        amount of $7,500,000 excluded from net bondable value of property
        additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of
        Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 4.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not issue or permit to be issued any prior lien bonds
        secured by an unfunded prior lien in addition to the prior lien bonds
        secured by such unfunded prior lien at the time of first acquisition by
        the Company of property subject thereto (other than in lieu of lost,
        stolen or mutilated bonds or on the exchange for bonds already
        outstanding of an equal principal amount of other bonds of the same
        issue and the same series, if any, and of the same maturity), except
        upon compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of Article IV of the
        Original Indenture, nor unless the net earnings of the Company available
        for interest after property retirement appropriations (determined as
        provided in Section 2 of Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July
        1, 1956), for any twelve consecutive calendar months during the period
        of fifteen calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the
        month in which the additional prior lien bonds are to be issued, have
        been, in the aggregate, equal to not less than

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
 
        twice the annual interest charges on the indebtedness specified in
        subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1) of Section 2(a) of said
        Article V; provided that, if the application for the issue of such
        additional prior lien bonds is upon the basis of payment at maturity of
        prior lien bonds theretofore sold or otherwise disposed of or the
        redemption or purchase thereof after a date two years prior to the date
        of maturity, the additional requirement imposed by this Section 4 with
        respect to net earnings of the Company available for interest after
        property retirement appropriations shall not apply.  Any officers'
        certificate with respect to net earnings of the Company, required to be
        filed with the Trustee as a condition precedent to the issue of such
        additional prior lien bonds, shall include, in addition to the matters
        otherwise required to be stated therein, the matters required to be
        stated in an officers' certificate pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of
        Section 2(a) of said Article V.

           SECTION 5.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not acquire, by purchase, merger or otherwise, any
        property subject to a lien or liens which will on acquisition be an
        unfunded prior lien or prior liens, except upon compliance with the
        provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the Original Indenture, nor
        unless the net earnings of such property available for interest after
        property retirement appropriations (determined in the manner provided in
        Section 2 of Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956),
        for any twelve consecutive calendar months during the period of fifteen
        calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the month in
        which the first acquisition of property subject to such lien or liens
        occurs, have been, in the aggregate, equal to not less than twice the
        amount of annual interest charges, on all outstanding indebtedness
        secured by such lien or liens.  Any officers' certificate with respect
        to net earnings of such property, required to be filed with the Trustee
        as a condition precedent to the acquisition of such property, shall
        include, in addition to the matters otherwise required to be stated
        therein, the matters required to be stated in an officers' certificate
        pursuant to Section 2 of said Article V applicable, however, only to the
        net earnings of such property and to the indebtedness secured by such
        liens to which such property is subject.



                                   ARTICLE V.

                                  THE TRUSTEE.

           The Trustee hereby accepts the trusts hereby declared and provided,
        and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions in the
        Original Indenture and in this Supplemental Indenture set forth, and
        upon the following terms and conditions:

                                      -21-

           The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or
        in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture
        or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the
        recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made by the Company
        solely.



                                  ARTICLE VI.

              CONSENTS AND AGREEMENTS OF HOLDERS OF THE NEW BONDS
                               TO CERTAIN MATTERS

           The Company, and the holders of the New Bonds by their acceptance and
        holding thereof, hereby consent and agree as follows:

              (A)  When the provisions of this Article VI shall become effective
           as provided in Subdivision (B) hereof, the provisions of the Original
           Indenture shall become and shall be deemed to have been, amended,
           effective on said date, by the Supplemental Indenture dated February
           1, 1974, in the following respects:

           (1) by inserting the following paragraph after the definition of
        "Nonbondable property" in Article I of the Original Indenture;

              The term 'Nuclear fuel' shall mean (a) any fuel element, including
           nuclear fuel and associated means (and any similar or analogous
           device or substance), whether or not classified as fuel and whether
           or not chargeable to operating expenses, comprising or intended to

           (2)  by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (e) of the
        definition of "Permitted liens" in Article I of the Original Indenture,
        changing the period at the end of subparagraph (f) of such definition to
        "; and", and adding a new subparagraph (g) reading as follows:

              "(g) any controls, liens, restrictions, regulations, easements,
           exceptions or reservations of any governmental authority applying
           particularly to 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (3) by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (d) of the
        third paragraph of the definition of "Property additions" in Article I
        of the Original Indenture, changing the period at the end of
        subparagraph (e) to "; and" and adding a new subparagraph (f) reading as
        follows:

              "(f) anything in this Indenture notwithstanding, the term
           'Property additions' shall include 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (4) by inserting after the words "such property additions" when first
        used in subdivision (4) of subparagraph (f) of Section 4 of Article III
        of the Original Indenture the following:

                ", provided that, in the case of property additions constituting
              all or part of a facility for the production of electricity by use
              of a nuclear reactor or any similar or analogous device, or
              Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components for use therein,
              in respect of which the application is made prior to receipt of
              necessary authority to operate such facility, such opinion need
              only state that (i) the Company has necessary authority to own
              such property additions and (ii) in the case of property additions
              for which construction authority is necessary, the Company has
              necessary authority to construct the same."

        and

           (5) by inserting after the words "any machinery or equipment," in
        subparagraph (a) of Section 2 of Article VII of the Original Indenture
        the following:

              "or any Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components,"

               (B)  The provisions of this Article VI shall become effective on
             the earliest date on which either (a) no Bonds of a Series prior to
             the Bonds of 2004 Series (as described in the Supplemental
             Indenture dated February 1, 1974) shall be outstanding or (b) the
             amendment to the Original Indenture provided in Article VII of the
             Supplemental Indenture dated February 1,

                                      -23-
<PAGE>
 
           1974, shall have become effective upon vote of the holders of Bonds
           as provided in Article XV of the Original Indenture, provided that no
           vote of the holders of the Bonds of 2004 Series or Bonds of any
           series created thereafter shall be required for effecting such
           amendments.



                                  ARTICLE VII.

                           RESERVATIONS BY COMPANY TO
                           AMEND ORIGINAL INDENTURE.

           SECTION 1.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof so as to substitute "sixty percent. (60%)" for
        "eighty percent. (80%)" wherever appearing in said Article XV.

           SECTION 2.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof by adding thereto a Section 9 to read as follows:

               "SECTION 9.  (A)  Anything in this Article XV contained to the
             contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent (in any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
             Bondholders or by their attorneys appointed in writing) of the
             holders of sixty percent. (60%) or more in principal amount of the
             Bonds outstanding hereunder, and, if the rights of one or more, but
             less than all, series of Bonds then outstanding are to be affected
             by action taken pursuant to such consent, then also by consent of
             the holders of at least sixty per cent. (60%) in principal amount
             of each  series of Bonds so to be affected and outstanding
             hereunder (at the time the last such needed consent is delivered to
             the Trustee) in lieu of the holding of a meeting pursuant to this
             Article XV and in lieu of all action at such a meeting and with the
             same force and effect as a resolution duly adopted in accordance
             with the provisions of Section 6 of this Article XV.

<PAGE>
 
              (B)  Instruments of consent shall be witnessed or in the
           alternative may (a) have the signature guaranteed by a bank or trust
           company or a registered dealer in securities, (b) be acknowledged
           before a Notary Public or other officer authorized to take
           acknowledgements, or (c) have their genuineness otherwise established
           to the satisfaction of the Trustee.

              The amount of Bonds payable to bearer, and the series and serial
           numbers thereof, held by a person executing an instrument of consent
           (or whose attorney has executed an instrument of consent in his
           behalf), and the date of his holding the same may be proved by
           exhibiting the Bonds to and obtaining a certificate executed by (i)
           any bank or trust or insurance company, or (ii) any trustee,
           secretary, administrator or other proper officer of any pension,
           welfare, hospitalization or similar fund or funds, or (iii) the
           United States of America, any Territory thereof, the District of
           Columbia, any State of the United States or any public
           instrumentality of the United States, or of any State or of any
           Territory, or (iv) any other person or corporation satisfactory to
           the Trustee.  A Bondholder in any of the foregoing categories may
           sign a certificate in his own behalf.

              Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state, in effect,
           that as of the date thereof, a coupon Bond or Bonds bearing a
           specified serial number or numbers was deposited with or exhibited to
           the signer of such certificate.  The holding by the person named in
           any such certificate of any Bond specified therein shall be presumed
           to continue unless (1) any certificate bearing a later date issued in
           respect of the same Bond shall be produced, (2)  the Bond specified
           in such certificate (or any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or
           substitution for such Bond) shall be produced by another holder, or
           (3) the Bond specified in such certificate shall be registered as to
           principal in the name of another holder or shall have been
           surrendered in exchange for a fully registered bond registered in the
           name of another holder.  The Trustee may nevertheless, in his
           discretion, require further proof in cases where it deems further
           proof desirable.  The ownership of registered Bonds shall be proved
           by the registry books.

               (C)  Until such time as the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent of the necessary per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds
             required by the provisions of subsection (A) above for action
             contemplated by such consent, any holder of a Bond, the serial
             number of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the
             Bonds the holders of which have consented to such action, may, by
             filing written notice with the Trustee at its principal office and
             upon proof of holding as provided in subsection (B) above, revoke
             such consent so far as it concerns such Bond.  Except as aforesaid,
             any such action taken by the holder of any Bond shall be conclusive
             and binding upon

                                      -25-
<PAGE>
 
           such holder and upon all future holders of such Bond (and any Bond
           issued in lieu thereof or exchanged therefor), irrespective of
           whether or not any notation of such consent is made upon such Bond,
           and in any event any action taken by the holders of the percentage in
           aggregate principal amount of the Bonds specified in subsection (A)
           above in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding
           upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Bonds."



                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                           MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

        in this Supplemental Indenture shall, for all purposes thereof, have the

           UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under
        the laws of the State of Missouri (hereinafter called the "Company",

        in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust, dated June 15, 1937,
        executed by the Company to Boatmen's Trust Company, (herein called the

        May 1, 1941, April 1, 1971, February 1, 1974, and July 7, 1980, between
        the Company and the Trustee (said mortgage and deed of trust, as so
        amended, being herein called the "Amended Indenture").  Such interest
        shall be payable from the April 1 or October 1, as the case may be, next
        preceding the date hereof to which interest has not been paid, unless
        the date hereof is an April 1 or October 1 to which interest has been
        paid, in which case from the date hereof, or unless the date hereof is
        prior to the first payment of interest, in which case from October 1,
        1993.  The interest so payable will be paid to the person in whose name
        this Bond, or the Bond in exchange or substitution for which this Bond

        this Bond at such holder's address as it shall appear on the books of
        the Company to be kept for that purpose.

           This Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Amended
        Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or
        obligatory for any purpose, until Boatmen's Trust Company, the Trustee
        under the Amended Indenture, or a successor trustee thereto under the
        Amended Indenture, or an agent therefor, shall have signed the form of
        certificate endorsed hereon.

           The Company has entered into a Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") with
        the Authority to provide for the payment of an issue by the Authority of
        $44,000,000 principal amount of Environmental Improvement Revenue Bonds
        (Union Electric Company Project) Series 1993, dated October 1, 1993 (the
        "Revenue Bonds"), issued pursuant to an Indenture of Trust dated as of
        October 1, 1993 between the Authority and Mercantile as Trustee (the
        "Trust Indenture"), for the purpose of providing funds for the
        acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of certain
        facilities of the Company comprising solid waste disposal facilities
        (the "Project"), pursuant to the provisions of Sections 260.005 to
        260.125, inclusive, R.S.Mo. 1986 as amended, and Appendix B(1) thereto.

           This Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company
        (herein called the "Bonds"), limited to an aggregate principal amount of
        $44,000,000, of the series hereinafter specified, all of which were
        issued to the Authority in satisfaction of payments required to be made
        by the Company pursuant to the Agreement and are to be assigned by the
        Authority to the trustee under the Trust Indenture and all issued and to
        be issued under and equally secured by the Amended Indenture, to which
        Amended Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is
        hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged and pledged,
        the nature and extent of the security, the rights of the bearers or
        registered owners of the Bonds and of the Trustee in respect

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
 
        thereto, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are, and are
        to be, secured.  To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the
        Amended Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Amended
        Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental thereto, and of the rights
        and obligations of the Company and of the holders of the Bonds may be
        made with the consent of the Company by an affirmative vote of not less
        than 80% in amount of the Bonds entitled to vote then outstanding, at a
        meeting of Bondholders called and held as provided in the Amended
        Indenture, and by an affirmative vote of not less than 80% in amount of
        the Bonds of any series entitled to vote then outstanding and affected
        by such modification or alteration, in case one or more but less than
        all of the series of Bonds then outstanding under the Amended Indenture
        are so affected.  The Company has reserved the right to amend the
        Amended Indenture without any consent or other action by holders of
        bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including the
        Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 1993, to provide that the Amended
        Indenture may be modified or altered with the consent of the holders of
        not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and if
        less than all series of Bonds are affected with the consent also of the
        holders of not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
        of each series so affected.  Additionally, the Company has reserved the
        right to amend the Amended Indenture, as supplemented, to authorize
        amendments thereto by an appropriate written consent of not less than
        60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding without a
        meeting of such Bondholders.  No such modification or alteration shall
        be made which will affect the terms of payment of the principal of, or
        interest on, this Bond, which are unconditional.  The Bonds may be
        issued in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different
        times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as in
        the Amended Indenture provided.  This Bond is one of a series designated
        as the "First Mortgage Bonds, Environmental Improvement Series 1993" of
        the Company, issued under and secured by the Amended Indenture and
        described in the indenture (hereinafter called the "Supplemental
        Indenture of October 1, 1993") dated October 1, 1993, between the
        Company and the Trustee, supplemental to the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds are subject to redemption as a whole at any time prior to
        maturity at the option of the Company, at the principal amount thereof,
        plus interest accrued to the redemption date, if any of the following
        events shall have occurred.

             (i) unreasonable, or excessive liabilities, including Federal,
           state or other property or income taxes not imposed on October 1,
           1993, are imposed upon the Authority or the Company with respect to
           the operation of a substantial portion of the Project and the Company
           determines to discontinue operation of such portion of the Project;
           or

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
             (ii) a substantial portion of the Project shall be damaged or
           destroyed, or use or control thereof shall be taken by the exercise
           of the power of eminent domain, to such extent that the Company
           determines that it is not practical or desirable to restore or
           replace such portion;

        any such redemption to be made within 90 days from the time the Company
        files with the registered owner of the Bonds a certificate evidencing
        the occurrence of one of the foregoing events and requesting redemption
        of the Bonds, which certificate and request must be filed, if at all,
        within 270 days following the occurrence of such event.

           The Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of the Company on
        or after October 1, 2008, in whole at any time or in part on any
        interest payment date, at the redemption prices (expressed as
        percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued interest,
        if any, to the redemption date:

                   Redemption Date                            Redemption
                  (Dates Inclusive)                              Price
                  -----------------                           ----------

        October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009...........     102%
        October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010...........     101%
        October 1, 2010 and thereafter.......................     100%

           The Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption at any time, as a
        whole or in part as provided below, on any day within 120 days after the
        Company receives written notice from a registered owner, beneficial
        owner, former registered owner or former beneficial owner of a Revenue
        Bond or Mercantile of a final determination by the Internal Revenue
        Service or a court of competent jurisdiction that, as a result of a
        failure by the Company to perform any of its agreements in the Agreement
        or the inaccuracy of any of its representations in the Agreement or any
        certificate submitted pursuant to the Trust Indenture, the interest paid
        or to be paid on any Revenue Bond (except to a "substantial user" of the
        Project or a "related person" within the meaning of Section 147(a) of
        the Code) is or was includible in the gross income of the Revenue Bond's
        owner for federal income tax purposes.  No such determination will be
        considered final unless the registered owner, beneficial owner, former
        registered owner or former beneficial owner involved in the
        determination gives the Company, the Trustee and Mercantile prompt
        written notice of the commencement of the proceedings resulting in the
        determination and offers the Company, subject to the Company's agreeing
        to pay all expenses of the proceeding and to indemnify the registered
        owner, beneficial owner, former registered owner or former beneficial
        owner against all liabilities that might result from it, the opportunity
        to control the defense of the proceeding and either the Company does not
        agree within 30 days to pay the expenses, indemnify the registered
        owner, beneficial owner, former registered owner or former beneficial
        owner and control the defense or the Company exhausts or chooses not to
        exhaust available procedures to contest or obtain review of the result
        of the proceedings.  Fewer than all the Bonds may be

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
        redeemed if redemption of fewer than all would result in the interest
        payable on the Bonds remaining outstanding being not includible in the
        gross income for federal income tax purposes of any owner other than a
        "substantial user" or "related person".  If fewer than all Bonds are
        redeemed, the Trustee will select the Bonds to be redeemed by lot as
        provided in the Amended Indenture or by such other method acceptable to
        the Trustee as may be specified in an Opinion of Tax Counsel.  If this
        redemption occurs in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture,
        such failure by the Company to perform any of its agreements in the
        Agreement or inaccuracy of any of its representations in the Agreement
        or any certificate submitted pursuant to the Amended Indenture shall not
        in and of itself constitute an event or default under the Trust
        Indenture or the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption at the principal
        amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption if
        the Trustee or the Company is notified that an "Event of Default" under
        the Trust Indenture has occurred and is continuing and Mercantile has
        declared the principal amount of all Revenue Bonds then outstanding due
        and payable in accordance with the Trust Indenture.

           The Company may, by notice to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to
        any date on which any principal payment is due on this Bond, elect to
        receive a credit in respect of such principal payment (a) for any Bonds
        of 1993 Series then due which have been redeemed prior to such principal
        payment date or otherwise acquired and delivered to the Trustee for
        cancellation by said Trustee prior to the giving of such notice, or (b)
        for any Revenue Bonds which have been purchased, delivered for
        cancellation or previously redeemed, which in each case have not
        theretofore been applied as a credit against such principal payment.
        Each Bond with respect to which the Company elects to receive a credit
        will be credited by the Trustee at 100% of the principal amount thereof
        against such principal payment, provided further that in the case of a
        credit with respect to any Revenue Bonds, the principal amount thereof
        shall be established by an officers' certificate (as defined in the
        Amended Indenture) concurred in by the trustee under the Trust
        Indenture, included with the above-mentioned notice to the Trustee.  The
        principal amount of Bonds to be paid on the due date of such principal
        payment will be reduced by the amount of any such credit or credits in
        respect of Bonds previously redeemed or delivered as provided above.

           Upon cancellation in full or in part of any of the Revenue Bonds (or
        provision for payment thereof having been made in accordance with the
        provisions of the Trust Indenture) and payment of all fees and charges
        of the trustee thereunder, such trustee shall deliver to the Trustee,
        for cancellation a corresponding amount of Bonds remaining in its
        possession.

           Such redemption in every case shall be effected upon notice delivered
        by the Company at least sixty days prior to the date of redemption, to
        the registered

                                      -17-
<PAGE>
 
        owner of the Bonds at its address as the same shall appear on the
        transfer register of the Company, all subject to the conditions of, and
        as more fully set forth in, the Amended Indenture and Supplemental
        Indenture of October 1, 1993.

           In case an event of default, as defined in the Amended Indenture,
        shall occur, the principal of all the bonds at any such time outstanding
        under the Amended Indenture may be declared or may become due and
        payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect
        provided in the Amended Indenture.  The Amended Indenture provides that
        such declaration may in certain events be waived by the holders of a
        majority in principal amount of the bonds outstanding.

           No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of,
        premium, if any, or on the interest on, this Bond, or for any claim
        based hereon or on the Amended Indenture or any indenture supplemental
        thereto, against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, director
        or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any
        predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the
        Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether for
        amounts unpaid on stock subscriptions or by virtue of any constitution,
        statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
        penalty or otherwise, all such liability, whether at common law, in
        equity, by any constitution, statute or otherwise, of incorporators,
        stockholders, directors or officers being released by every owner hereof
        by the acceptance of this Bond and as part of the consideration for the
        issue hereof, and being likewise released by the terms of the Amended
        Indenture.

           IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Union Electric Company has caused this Bond to be
        signed in its name by its Chairman of the Board or President or a Vice
        President by his manual signature or a facsimile thereof, and its

                                  ARTICLE II.

                         ISSUE of BONDS of SERIES 1993

           SECTION 1.  The principal amount of the Bonds of Series 1993 which
        may be authenticated and delivered hereunder is limited to the aggregate
        principal amount of Forty-four Million Dollars ($44,000,000) consisting
        of Bonds maturing on the first day of October 2028.

           SECTION 2.  Bonds of Series 1993 in the principal amount as set forth
        above may forthwith be executed by the Company and delivered to the
        Trustee and shall be authenticated by the Trustee and delivered (either

        the Company, upon compliance by the Company with the applicable
        provisions of Article III and Article XVIII of the Original Indenture.


                                  ARTICLE III.

                                   REDEMPTION

           SECTION 1.  The Bonds of Series 1993 shall, subject to the provisions
        of Article V of the Original Indenture, be redeemable at any time or
        from time to time prior to maturity, at the option of the Board of
        Directors of the Company, either as a whole or in part, at the then
        applicable redemption price set forth in the form of Bonds of Series
        1993 in Section 3 of Article I of this Supplemental Indenture, together,
        in each case, with accrued interest to the redemption date.  In the
        event that less than all of such Bonds of Series 1993 are to be
        redeemed, the Bonds to be redeemed shall be determined by lot in such
        manner as the Trustee in its discretion shall deem proper, as in the
        Original Indenture provided.

           The Bonds of Series 1993 are also subject to mandatory redemption as
        set forth in the form of Bonds of Series 1993 in Section 3 of Article I
        of this Supplemental Indenture.

           SECTION 2.  Subject to the provisions of Article V of the Original
        Indenture, notice of redemption shall be delivered by the Company at
        least sixty days prior to the date of redemption, to the registered
        owner of such Bonds at its address as the same shall appear on the
        transfer register of the Company.


           SECTION 3.  As provided in the Trust Indenture, any amounts of money
        held in the Bond Fund provided in said Indenture and available for such
        purpose, which are at the request of the Company applied to the payments
        of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Revenue Bonds
        on any payment or redemption date, shall be applied as a credit on
        amounts otherwise due under Bonds of Series 1993; provided that the
        amount of such credit shall be established by an officers' certificate
        (as defined in the Original Indenture), concurred in by the trustee
        under the Trust Indenture, which shall be filed with the Trustee prior
        to the application of any such credit.

           Upon cancellation in full or in part of any of the Revenue Bonds (or
        provision for payment thereof having been made in accordance with the
        provisions of the Trust Indenture) and payment of all fees and charges
        of the trustee thereunder, such trustee shall deliver to Boatmen's Trust
        Company, Trustee for the First Mortgage Bonds of the Company, for
        cancellation a corresponding amount of Bonds of Series 1993 remaining in
        its possession or shall request such Trustee to issue a new Bond of
        Series 1993 reflecting any such cancellation.

           The Company hereby covenants, warrants and agrees;

           SECTION 1.  That the Company is lawfully seized and possessed of all
        of the mortgaged property described in the granting clauses of this
        Supplemental Indenture; that it has good right and lawful authority to
        mortgage the same as provided in this Supplemental Indenture; and that
        such mortgaged property is, at the actual date of the issue of the Bonds
        of Series 1993, free and clear of any deed of trust, mortgage, lien,
        charge or encumbrance thereon or affecting the title thereto prior to
        the Original Indenture, except as set forth in the granting clauses of
        the Original Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture.

           SECTION 2.  That, so long as any of the Bonds of Series 1993 are
        outstanding, whenever any officers' certificate is required to be filed
        or deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 3(b) of Article III of
        the Original Indenture upon an application for the authentication of
        additional Bonds pursuant to Article III of the Original Indenture, such
        officers' certificate shall include, in addition to the matters required
        to be stated therein by said Section 3(b), the statement with respect to
        the net earnings of the Company available for interest after property
        retirement appropriations required by Section 2 of Article V of the
        Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 3.  That, so long as any of the Bonds of Series 1993 are
        outstanding, the Company will not apply for the authentication and
        delivery of additional bonds pursuant to Section 4 of Article III of the
        Original Indenture or the withdrawal of cash from the trust estate or
        the reduction of the amount of cash required to be paid into the trust
        estate or to satisfy the maintenance and improvement funds under any
        provision of the Original Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures
        creating prior series of bonds, on the basis of the amount of
        $15,000,000 excluded from net bondable value of property additions not
        subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of Article V of
        the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 1945, or on the basis of the
        amount of $7,500,000 excluded from net bondable value of property
        additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of
        Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 4.  That, so long as any of the Bonds of Series 1993 are
        outstanding, the Company will not issue or permit to be issued any prior
        lien bonds secured by an unfunded prior lien in addition to the prior
        lien bonds secured by such unfunded prior lien at the time of first
        acquisition by the Company of property subject thereto (other than in
        lieu of lost, stolen or mutilated bonds or on the exchange for bonds
        already outstanding of an equal principal amount of other bonds of the
        same issue and the same series, if any, and of the same maturity),
        except upon compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of Article IV
        of the Original Indenture, nor unless the net earnings of the Company
        available for interest after property retirement appropriations
        (determined as provided in Section 2 of Article V of the Supplemental
        Indenture of July 1, 1956), for any twelve consecutive calendar months
        during the period of fifteen calendar months immediately preceding the
        first day of the month in which the additional prior lien bonds are to
        be issued, have been, in the aggregate, equal to not less than twice the
        annual interest charges on the indebtedness specified in subparagraphs
        (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1) of Section 2(a) of said Article V;
        provided that, if the application for the issue of such additional prior
        lien bonds is upon the basis of payment at maturity of prior lien bonds
        theretofore sold or otherwise disposed of or the redemption or purchase
        thereof after a date two years prior to the date of maturity, the
        additional requirement imposed by this Section 4 with respect to net
        earnings of the Company available for interest after property retirement
        appropriations shall not

                                      -21-

        apply.  Any officers' certificate with respect to net earnings of the
        Company, required to be filed with the Trustee as a condition precedent
        to the issue of such additional prior lien bonds, shall include, in
        addition to the matters otherwise required to be stated therein, the
        matters required to be stated in an officers' certificate pursuant to
        paragraphs (1) and (2) of Section 2(a) of said Article V.

           SECTION 5.  That, so long as any of the Bonds of Series 1993 are
        outstanding, the Company will not acquire, by purchase, merger or
        otherwise, any property subject to a lien or liens which will on
        acquisition be an unfunded prior lien or prior liens, except upon
        compliance with the provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the
        Original Indenture, nor unless the net earnings of such property
        available for interest after property retirement appropriations
        (determined in the manner provided in Section 2 of Article V of the
        Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956), for any twelve consecutive
        calendar months during the period of fifteen calendar months immediately
        preceding the first day of the month in which the first acquisition of
        property subject to such lien or liens occurs, have been, in the
        aggregate, equal to not less than twice the amount of annual interest
        charges, on all outstanding indebtedness secured by such lien or liens.
        Any officers' certificate with respect to net earnings of such property,
        required to be filed with the Trustee as a condition precedent to the
        acquisition of such property, shall include, in addition to the matters
        otherwise required to be stated therein, the matters required to be
        stated in an officers' certificate pursuant to Section 2 of said Article
        V applicable, however, only to the net earnings of such property and to
        the indebtedness secured by such liens to which such property is
        subject.


                                   ARTICLE V.

                                  THE TRUSTEE.

        in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture
        or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the
        recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made by the Company
        solely.

                         SERIES 1993 TO CERTAIN MATTERS

           The Company, and the holders of the Bonds of Series 1993 by their
        acceptance and holding thereof, hereby consent and agree as follows:

              (A)  When the provisions of this Article VI shall become effective
           as provided in Subdivision (B) hereof, the provisions of the Original
           Indenture shall become and shall be deemed to have been, amended,
           effective on said date, by the Supplemental Indenture dated February
           1, 1974, in the following respects:

           (1) by inserting the following paragraph after the definition of
        "Nonbondable property" in Article I of the Original Indenture;

           "Nuclear fuel:

              The term 'Nuclear fuel' shall mean (a) any fuel element, including
           nuclear fuel and associated means (and any similar or analogous
           device or substance), whether or not classified as fuel and whether
           or not chargeable to operating expenses, comprising or intended to
           comprise or formerly comprising the core, or other part of a nuclear
           reactor or any similar or analogous device, (b) any fuel element,
           including nuclear fuel and associated means (and any similar or
           analogous device or substance) while in the process of fabrication or
           preparation and special nuclear or other materials held for use in
           such fabrication or preparation, (c) any substances or materials
           formerly comprising such nuclear fuel and associated means (or any

           uranium, thorium, plutonium, and any other substance or material from
           time to time used or selected for use by the Company as fuel
           material, or as potential fuel material, in a nuclear reactor or any
           similar or analogous device."

           (2)  by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (e) of the
        definition of "Permitted liens" in Article I of the Original Indenture,
        changing the period at the end of subparagraph (f) of such definition to
        "; and", and adding a new subparagraph (g) reading as follows:

              "(g) any controls, liens, restrictions, regulations, easements,
           exceptions or reservations of any governmental authority applying
           particularly to 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (3) by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (d) of the
        third paragraph of the definition of "Property additions" in Article I
        of the Original

                                      -23-

        Indenture, changing the period at the end of subparagraph (e) to "; and"
        and adding a new subparagraph (f) reading as follows:

              "(f) anything in this Indenture notwithstanding, the term
           'Property additions' shall include 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (4) by inserting after the words "such property additions" when first
        used in subdivision (4) of subparagraph (f) of Section 4 of Article III
        of the Original Indenture the following:

                ", provided that, in the case of property additions constituting
              all or part of a facility for the production of electricity by use
              of a nuclear reactor or any similar or analogous device, or
              Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components for use therein,
              in respect of which the application is made prior to receipt of
              necessary authority to operate such facility, such opinion need
              only state that (i) the Company has necessary authority to own
              such property additions and (ii) in the case of property additions
              for which construction authority is necessary, the Company has
              necessary authority to construct the same."

        and

           (5) by inserting after the words "any machinery or equipment," in
        subparagraph (a) of Section 2 of Article VII of the Original Indenture
        the following:

              "or any Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components,"

              (B)  The provisions of this Article VI shall become effective on
           the earliest date on which either (a) no Bonds of a Series prior to
           the Bonds of 2004 Series shall be outstanding or (b) the amendment to
           the Original Indenture provided in Article VII of the Supplemental
           Indenture dated February 1, 1974, shall have become effective upon
           vote of the holders of Bonds as provided in Article XV of the
           Original Indenture, provided that no vote of the holders of the Bonds
           of 2004 Series or Bonds of any series created thereafter shall be
           required for effecting such amendments.


                                  ARTICLE VII.

                           RESERVATIONS BY COMPANY TO
                           AMEND ORIGINAL INDENTURE.

           SECTION 1.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
 
        supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this Supplemental
        Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original Indenture, as
        supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Article XV thereof
        so as to substitute "sixty percent. (60%)" for "eighty percent. (80%)"
        wherever appearing in said Article XV.

           SECTION 2.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof by adding thereto a Section 9 to read as follows:

               "SECTION 9.  (A)  Anything in this Article XV contained to the
             contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent (in any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
             Bondholders or by their attorneys appointed in writing) of the
             holders of sixty percent. (60%) or more in principal amount of the
             Bonds outstanding hereunder, and, if the rights of one or more, but
             less than all, series of Bonds then outstanding are to be affected
             by action taken pursuant to such consent, then also by consent of
             the holders of at least sixty per cent. (60%) in principal amount
             of each  series of Bonds so to be affected and outstanding
             hereunder (at the time the last such needed consent is delivered to
             the Trustee) in lieu of the holding of a meeting pursuant to this
             Article XV and in lieu of all action at such a meeting and with the
             same force and effect as a resolution duly adopted in accordance
             with the provisions of Section 6 of this Article XV.

              (B)  Instruments of consent shall be witnessed or in the
           alternative may (a) have the signature guaranteed by a bank or trust
           company or a registered dealer in securities, (b) be acknowledged
           before a Notary Public or other officer authorized to take
           acknowledgements, or (c) have their genuineness otherwise established
           to the satisfaction of the Trustee.

              The amount of Bonds payable to bearer, and the series and serial
           numbers thereof, held by a person executing an instrument of consent
           (or whose attorney has executed an instrument of consent in his
           behalf), and the date of his holding the same may be proved by
           exhibiting the Bonds to and obtaining a certificate executed by (i)
           any bank or trust or insurance company, or (ii) any trustee,
           secretary, administrator or other proper officer of any pension,
           welfare, hospitalization or similar fund or funds, or (iii) the
           United States of America, any Territory thereof, the District of
           Columbia, any State of the United States or any public
           instrumentality of the United States, or of any State or of any
           Territory, or (iv) any other person or corporation satisfactory to
           the Trustee.  A Bondholder in any of the foregoing categories may
           sign a certificate in his own behalf.

                                      -25-

           Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state, in effect, that
           as of the date thereof, a coupon Bond or Bonds bearing a specified
           serial number or numbers was deposited with or exhibited to the
           signer of such certificate.  The holding by the person named in any
           such certificate of any Bond specified therein shall be presumed to
           continue unless (1) any certificate bearing a later date issued in
           respect of the same Bond shall be produced, (2)  the Bond specified
           in such certificate (or any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or
           substitution for such Bond) shall be produced by another holder, or
           (3) the Bond specified in such certificate shall be registered as to
           principal in the name of another holder or shall have been
           surrendered in exchange for a fully registered bond registered in the
           name of another holder.  The Trustee may nevertheless, in his
           discretion, require further proof in cases where it deems further
           proof desirable.  The ownership of registered Bonds shall be proved
           by the registry books.

              (C)  Until such time as the Trustee shall receive the written
           consent of the necessary per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds
           required by the provisions of subsection (A) above for action
           contemplated by such consent, any holder of a Bond, the serial number
           of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Bonds the
           holders of which have consented to such action, may, by filing
           written notice with the Trustee at its principal office and upon
           proof of holding as provided in subsection (B) above, revoke such
           consent so far as it concerns such Bond.  Except as aforesaid, any
           such action taken by the holder of any Bond shall be conclusive and
           binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of such Bond
           (and any Bond issued in lieu thereof or exchanged therefor),
           irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent is made
           upon such Bond, and in any event any action taken by the holders of
           the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds specified
           in subsection (A) above in connection with such action shall be
           conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of
           all the Bonds."

                                   ARTICLE I.

                          DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW BONDS

           SECTION 1.  There is hereby created a new series of Bonds to be
        executed, authenticated and delivered under and secured by the Original
        Indenture which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 1 of Article
        II of the Original Indenture, be designated as "First Mortgage Bonds, 7%
        Series due 2024" (the "New Bonds") of the Company.  The New Bonds shall
        be executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the
        provisions of, and shall in all respects be subject to all of the terms,
        conditions and covenants of, the Original Indenture.

           The New Bonds shall mature January 15, 2024, and shall bear interest
        at the rate per annum set forth in the form of the New Bond contained in
        Section 3 of this Article I, payable semi-annually on the fifteenth day
        of January and the fifteenth day of July in each year.  The New Bonds
        shall be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest in any
        coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of
        payment is legal tender for public and private debts, and shall be
        payable at the office of the Company in the City of St. Louis, Missouri;
        provided, however, that at the option of the Company, interest on the
        New Bonds may be paid by checks mailed to the registered holder in whose
        name such Bonds are registered at the address as it shall appear on the
        transfer register of the Company.

           SECTION 2.  The New Bonds shall be registered Bonds without coupons,
        of the denomination of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

           The New Bonds shall be transferable and exchangeable for the New
        Bonds of other denominations, as in the Original Indenture provided,
        except that payment of a service charge therefor will not be required by
        the Company.

           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 of Article II of the
        Original Indenture, the New Bonds shall be dated the date of
        authentication and shall bear interest from the interest payment date to
        which interest on the New Bonds has been paid next preceding the date
        thereof, unless such date is an interest payment date to which interest
        has been paid, in which case they shall bear interest from the date
        thereof, or unless the date thereof is prior to July 15, 1994, in which
        case they shall bear interest from January 15, 1994; provided, however,
        that, subject to the provisions of this Section with respect to failure
        by the Company to pay any interest on an interest payment date, the
        holder of any New Bond dated after a record date (as hereinafter
        defined) for the payment of interest and prior to the date of payment of
        such interest shall not be entitled to payment of such interest and
        shall have no claim against the Company with respect thereto.

           The person in whose name any New Bond is registered at the close of
        business on any record date with respect to any interest payment date
        shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such interest
        payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Bond upon any
        transfer or exchange thereof subsequent to the record date and prior to
        such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Company
        shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest
        payment date, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the
        person in whose name such Bond is registered on the date of payment of
        such defaulted interest or on a subsequent record date for such payment
        if one shall have been established as hereinafter provided.  A
        subsequent record date may be established by the Company by notice
        mailed to the holders of the New Bonds not less than ten days preceding
        such record date, which record date shall be not more than thirty days
        prior to the subsequent interest payment date.  The term "record date"
        as used in this Section with respect to any regular interest payment
        date shall mean the December 15 or June 15, as the case may be, next
        preceding such interest payment date, or, if such December 15 or June 15
        shall be a legal holiday in the State of New York or in the State of
        Missouri or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough of
        Manhattan, The City of New York, or the City of St. Louis, Missouri, are

        paid, in which case from the date hereof, or unless the date hereof is

                           [FORM OF TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE]

           This Bond is one of the Bonds, of the series designated therein,
        described in the within-mentioned Amended Indenture and Supplemental
        Indenture of January 1, 1994.

                                      Boatmen's Trust Company,
                                      Trustee.

        By Union Electric Company, Agent

                         [FORM OF REVERSE OF NEW BOND]

           This Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company
        (herein called the "Bonds"), in unlimited aggregate principal amount, of
        the series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under and
        equally secured by indenture of mortgage and deed of trust, dated June
        15, 1937, executed by the Company to Boatmen's Trust Company, (herein
        called the "Trustee"), as trustee, as amended by indentures supplemental
        thereto dated May 1, 1941, April 1, 1971, February 1, 1974, and July 7,
        1980, between the Company and the Trustee (said mortgage and deed of
        trust, as so amended, being herein called the "Amended Indenture"), to
        which Amended Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
        reference is hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged
        and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of the
        bearers or registered owners of the Bonds and of the Trustee in respect
        thereto, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are, and are
        to be, secured.  To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the
        Amended Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Amended
        Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental thereto, and of the rights
        and obligations of the Company and of the holders of the Bonds may be
        made with the consent of the Company by an affirmative vote of not less
        than 80% in amount of the Bonds entitled to vote then outstanding, at a
        meeting of Bondholders called and held as provided in the Amended
        Indenture, and by an affirmative vote of not less than 80% in amount of
        the Bonds of any series entitled to vote then outstanding and affected
        by such modification or alteration, in case one or more but less than
        all of the series of Bonds then outstanding under the Amended Indenture
        are so affected.  The Company has reserved the right to amend the
        Amended Indenture without any consent or other action by holders of
        bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including the
        Supplemental Indenture of January 1, 1994, to provide that the Amended
        Indenture may be modified or altered with the consent of the holders of
        not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and if
        less than all series of Bonds are affected with the consent also of the
        holders of not less than 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
        of each series so affected.  Additionally, the Company has reserved the
        right to amend the Amended Indenture, as supplemented, to authorize
        amendments thereto by

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
        an appropriate written consent of not less than 60% in aggregate
        principal amount of the Bonds outstanding without a meeting of such
        Bondholders.  No such modification or alteration shall be made which
        will affect the terms of payment of the principal of, or interest or
        premium on, this Bond, which are unconditional.  The Bonds may be issued
        in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different times,
        may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as in the
        Amended Indenture provided.  This Bond is one of a series designated as
        the "First Mortgage Bonds, 7% Series due 2024" (herein called the "Bonds
        of this Series") of the Company, issued under and secured by the Amended
        Indenture and described in the indenture (hereinafter called the "New
        Supplemental Indenture") dated January 1, 1994, between the Company and
        the Trustee, supplemental to the Amended Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are not entitled to the benefit of any
        improvement, maintenance or analogous fund.

           The Bonds of this Series will be redeemable at the option of the
        Company, in whole or in part, at any time, upon the payment of
        redemption prices applicable to the respective periods set forth below;
        provided, however, that none of such Bonds shall be redeemed prior to
        January 15, 2004.

        in each case, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for
        redemption.

           Such redemption in every case shall be effected upon notice sent by
        the Company to the registered owner hereof, postage prepaid, at least
        thirty and not more than sixty days prior to the date of redemption, all
        subject to the conditions of, and as more fully set forth in, the
        Amended Indenture and the New Supplemental Indenture.

           In case an event of default, as defined in the Amended Indenture,
        shall occur, the principal of all the Bonds at any such time outstanding
        under the Amended Indenture may be declared or may become due and
        payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect
        provided in the Amended

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
        Indenture.  The Amended Indenture provides that such declaration may in
        certain events be waived by the holders of a majority in principal
        amount of the Bonds outstanding.

           This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof, in person
        or by duly authorized attorney, on the books of the Company to be kept
        for that purpose at the office of the Company in the City of St. Louis,
        Missouri, upon surrender and cancellation of this Bond and on
        presentation of a duly executed written instrument of transfer, and
        thereupon a new Bond or Bonds of the same series, of the same aggregate
        principal amount and in authorized denominations will be issued to the
        transferee or transferees in exchange herefor, without payment of any
        charge other than stamp taxes and other governmental charges incident
        thereto; and this Bond with or without others of like series, may in
        like manner be exchanged for one or more new Bonds of the same series of
        other authorized denominations but of the same aggregate principal
        amount; all subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended
        Indenture.

           The Bonds of this Series are to be issued initially under a book-
        entry only system and, except as hereinafter provided, will be
        registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New
        York ("DTC") or its nominee, which shall be considered to be the holder
        of all of the Bonds of this Series for all purposes of the Mortgage,
        including, without limitation, payment by the Company of principal of
        and interest on such Bonds of this Series and receipt of notices and
        exercise of rights of holders of such Bonds of this Series.  There shall
        be a single global bond of this series which shall be immobilized in the
        custody of DTC or its designee with the owners of book-entry interest in
        Bonds of this Series ("Book-Entry Interests") having no right to receive
        Bonds of this Series in the form of physical securities or certificates.
        Ownership of Book-Entry Interests shall be shown by book-entry on the
        system maintained and operated by DTC, its participants (the
        "Participants") and certain persons acting through the Participants.
        Transfers of ownership of Book-Entry Interests are to be made only by
        DTC and the Participants by that book-entry system, the Company and the
        Trustee having no responsibility therefor so long as Bonds of this
        Series are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee.  DTC is to
        maintain records of the positions of Participants in Bonds of this
        Series, and the Participants and persons acting through Participants are
        to maintain records of the purchasers and owners of Book-Entry
        Interests.  If DTC or its nominee determines not to continue to act as a
        depository for the Bonds of this Series in connection with a book-entry
        only system, another depository, if available, may act instead and the
        single global bond of this series will be transferred into the name of
        such other depository or its nominee, in which case the above provisions
        will continue to apply but to the new depository.  If the book-entry
        only system for Bonds of this Series is discontinued by the Company for
        any reason, upon surrender and cancellation of the single global bond of
        this series registered in the name of the then depository or its
        nominee, new registered Bonds of this Series will be issued in
        authorized denominations to the holders of Book-Entry Interests in
        principal amounts

                                      -17-
<PAGE>
 
        coinciding with the amounts of such Book-Entry Interests shown on the
        book-entry system immediately prior to the discontinuance thereof.
        Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall be responsible for the
        accuracy of the interests shown on that system.

           No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of,
        premium, if any, on or the interest on, this Bond, or for any claim
        based hereon or on the Amended Indenture or any indenture supplemental
        thereto, against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, director
        or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any
        predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the
        Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether for
        amounts unpaid on stock subscriptions or by virtue of any constitution,
        statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
        penalty or otherwise, all such liability, whether at common law, in
        equity, by any constitution, statute or otherwise, of incorporators,
        stockholders, directors or officers being released by every owner hereof
        by the acceptance of this Bond and as part of the consideration for the
        issue hereof, and being likewise released by the terms of the Amended
        Indenture.

           SECTION 4.  Until New Bonds in definitive form are ready for
        delivery, the Company may execute, and upon its request in writing the
        Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu thereof, New Bonds in
        temporary form, as provided in Section 9 of Article II of the Original
        Indenture.  New Bonds in temporary form may, in lieu of the specific
        redemption prices, if any, required to be set forth in New Bonds in
        definitive form, include a reference to this Supplemental Indenture for
        a statement of such redemption prices.



                                  ARTICLE II.

           SECTION 1.  The principal amount of the New Bonds which may be
        authenticated and delivered hereunder are not limited except as the
        Original Indenture limits the principal amount of Bonds which may be
        issued thereunder.

           SECTION 2.  The New Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of One
        Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), being the initial issue of the
        New Bonds, may forthwith at any time or from time to time be executed by
        the Company and delivered to the Trustee and shall be authenticated by
        the Trustee and delivered (either before or after the filing or
        recording hereof) to or upon the order of the Company, upon compliance
        by the Company with the applicable provisions of Article III and Article
        XVIII of the Original Indenture.

           SECTION 1.  The New Bonds shall, subject to the provisions of Article
        V of the Original Indenture, be redeemable at any time or from time to
        time prior to maturity, at the option of the Board of Directors of the
        Company or pursuant to Section 8 of Article VIII of the Original
        Indenture, either as a whole or in part, at the then applicable
        redemption price set forth in the form of New Bonds in Section 3 of
        Article I of this Supplemental Indenture, together, in each case, with
        accrued interest to the redemption date.

           In case of the redemption of less than all the outstanding New Bonds,
        the particular New Bonds or portions (equal to $1,000 or an integral
        multiple thereof) of the New Bonds of a denomination larger than $1,000
        to be redeemed shall be determined by lot in such manner as the Trustee
        in its discretion shall deem proper, as in the Original Indenture
        provided.

           Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 1, the New Bonds shall
        not be redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to
        January 15, 2004.

           There shall be no improvement, maintenance or analogous fund for the
        New Bonds.

           SECTION 2.  Subject to the provisions of Article V of the Original
        Indenture, notice of redemption shall be delivered by the Company at
        least thirty and not more than sixty days prior to the date of
        redemption, to the registered owners of the New Bonds to be redeemed at
        their addresses as they appear on the transfer register of the Company,
        except that failure to so mail a notice shall not affect the validity of
        the proceedings for redemption of any other New Bonds.



                                  ARTICLE IV.

                                   COVENANTS.

           The Company hereby covenants, warrants and agrees;

           SECTION 1.  That the Company is lawfully seized and possessed of all

        Supplemental Indenture; that it has good right and lawful authority to
        mortgage the same as provided in this Supplemental Indenture; and that
        such mortgaged property is, at

        the actual date of the issue of the New Bonds, free and clear of any
        deed of trust, mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or
        affecting the title thereto prior to the Original Indenture, except as
        set forth in the granting clauses of the Original Indenture or this
        Supplemental Indenture.

           SECTION 2.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        whenever any officers' certificate is required to be filed or deposited
        with the Trustee pursuant to Section 3(b) of Article III of the Original
        Indenture upon an application for the authentication of additional Bonds
        pursuant to Article III of the Original Indenture, such officers'
        certificate shall include, in addition to the matters required to be
        stated therein by said Section 3(b), the statement with respect to the
        net earnings of the Company available for interest after property
        retirement appropriations required by Section 2 of Article V of the
        Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 3.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not apply for the authentication and delivery of
        additional Bonds pursuant to Section 4 of Article III of the Original
        Indenture or the withdrawal of cash from the trust estate or the
        reduction of the amount of cash required to be paid into the trust
        estate or to satisfy the maintenance and improvement funds under any
        provision of the Original Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures
        creating prior series of Bonds, on the basis of the amount of
        $15,000,000 excluded from net bondable value of property additions not
        subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of Article V of
        the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 1945, or on the basis of the
        amount of $7,500,000 excluded from net bondable value of property
        additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien pursuant to Section 3 of
        Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956.

           SECTION 4.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not issue or permit to be issued any prior lien bonds
        secured by an unfunded prior lien in addition to the prior lien bonds
        secured by such unfunded prior lien at the time of first acquisition by
        the Company of property subject thereto (other than in lieu of lost,
        stolen or mutilated bonds or on the exchange for bonds already
        outstanding of an equal principal amount of other bonds of the same
        issue and the same series, if any, and of the same maturity), except
        upon compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of Article IV of the
        Original Indenture, nor unless the net earnings of the Company available
        for interest after property retirement appropriations (determined as
        provided in Section 2 of Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July
        1, 1956), for any twelve consecutive calendar months during the period
        of fifteen calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the
        month in which the additional prior lien bonds are to be issued, have
        been, in the aggregate, equal to not less than

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
 
        twice the annual interest charges on the indebtedness specified in
        subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1) of Section 2(a) of said
        Article V; provided that, if the application for the issue of such
        additional prior lien bonds is upon the basis of payment at maturity of
        prior lien bonds theretofore sold or otherwise disposed of or the
        redemption or purchase thereof after a date two years prior to the date
        of maturity, the additional requirement imposed by this Section 4 with
        respect to net earnings of the Company available for interest after
        property retirement appropriations shall not apply.  Any officers'
        certificate with respect to net earnings of the Company, required to be
        filed with the Trustee as a condition precedent to the issue of such
        additional prior lien bonds, shall include, in addition to the matters
        otherwise required to be stated therein, the matters required to be
        stated in an officers' certificate pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of
        Section 2(a) of said Article V.

           SECTION 5.  That, so long as any of the New Bonds are outstanding,
        the Company will not acquire, by purchase, merger or otherwise, any
        property subject to a lien or liens which will on acquisition be an
        unfunded prior lien or prior liens, except upon compliance with the
        provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the Original Indenture, nor
        unless the net earnings of such property available for interest after
        property retirement appropriations (determined in the manner provided in
        Section 2 of Article V of the Supplemental Indenture of July 1, 1956),
        for any twelve consecutive calendar months during the period of fifteen
        calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the month in
        which the first acquisition of property subject to such lien or liens
        occurs, have been, in the aggregate, equal to not less than twice the
        amount of annual interest charges, on all outstanding indebtedness
        secured by such lien or liens.  Any officers' certificate with respect
        to net earnings of such property, required to be filed with the Trustee
        as a condition precedent to the acquisition of such property, shall
        include, in addition to the matters otherwise required to be stated
        therein, the matters required to be stated in an officers' certificate
        pursuant to Section 2 of said Article V applicable, however, only to the
        net earnings of such property and to the indebtedness secured by such
        liens to which such property is subject.



                                   ARTICLE V.

                                  THE TRUSTEE.

           The Trustee hereby accepts the trusts hereby declared and provided,
        and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions in the
        Original Indenture and in this Supplemental Indenture set forth, and
        upon the following terms and conditions:

           (2)  by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (e) of the
        definition of "Permitted liens" in Article I of the Original Indenture,
        changing the period at the end of subparagraph (f) of such definition to
        "; and", and adding a new subparagraph (g) reading as follows:

              "(g) any controls, liens, restrictions, regulations, easements,
           exceptions or reservations of any governmental authority applying
           particularly to 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (3) by deleting the word "and" at the end of subparagraph (d) of the
        third paragraph of the definition of "Property additions" in Article I
        of the Original Indenture, changing the period at the end of
        subparagraph (e) to "; and" and adding a new subparagraph (f) reading as
        follows:

              "(f) anything in this Indenture notwithstanding, the term
           'Property additions' shall include 'Nuclear fuel'."

           (4) by inserting after the words "such property additions" when first
        used in subdivision (4) of subparagraph (f) of Section 4 of Article III
        of the Original Indenture the following:

                ", provided that, in the case of property additions constituting
              all or part of a facility for the production of electricity by use
              of a nuclear reactor or any similar or analogous device, or
              Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components for use therein,
              in respect of which the application is made prior to receipt of
              necessary authority to operate such facility, such opinion need
              only state that (i) the Company has necessary authority to own
              such property additions and (ii) in the case of property additions
              for which construction authority is necessary, the Company has
              necessary authority to construct the same."

        and

           (5) by inserting after the words "any machinery or equipment," in
        subparagraph (a) of Section 2 of Article VII of the Original Indenture
        the following:

              "or any Nuclear fuel materials, assemblies or components,"

               (B)  The provisions of this Article VI shall become effective on
             the earliest date on which either (a) no Bonds of a Series prior to
             the Bonds of 2004 Series (as described in the Supplemental
             Indenture dated February 1, 1974) shall be outstanding or (b) the
             amendment to the Original Indenture provided in Article VII of the
             Supplemental Indenture dated February 1,

<PAGE>
 
           1974, shall have become effective upon vote of the holders of Bonds
           as provided in Article XV of the Original Indenture, provided that no
           vote of the holders of the Bonds of 2004 Series or Bonds of any
           series created thereafter shall be required for effecting such
           amendments.



                                  ARTICLE VII.

                           RESERVATIONS BY COMPANY TO
                           AMEND ORIGINAL INDENTURE.

           SECTION 1.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof so as to substitute "sixty percent. (60%)" for
        "eighty percent. (80%)" wherever appearing in said Article XV.

           SECTION 2.  The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate
        corporate action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
        Bonds of any series created by the Supplemental Indenture of August 16,
        1976, or by any supplemental indenture dated thereafter, including this
        Supplemental Indenture, to make such amendments to the Original
        Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend
        Article XV thereof by adding thereto a Section 9 to read as follows:

               "SECTION 9.  (A)  Anything in this Article XV contained to the
             contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent (in any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
             Bondholders or by their attorneys appointed in writing) of the
             holders of sixty percent. (60%) or more in principal amount of the
             Bonds outstanding hereunder, and, if the rights of one or more, but
             less than all, series of Bonds then outstanding are to be affected
             by action taken pursuant to such consent, then also by consent of
             the holders of at least sixty per cent. (60%) in principal amount
             of each  series of Bonds so to be affected and outstanding
             hereunder (at the time the last such needed consent is delivered to
             the Trustee) in lieu of the holding of a meeting pursuant to this
             Article XV and in lieu of all action at such a meeting and with the
             same force and effect as a resolution duly adopted in accordance
             with the provisions of Section 6 of this Article XV.

              (B)  Instruments of consent shall be witnessed or in the
           alternative may (a) have the signature guaranteed by a bank or trust
           company or a registered dealer in securities, (b) be acknowledged
           before a Notary Public or other officer authorized to take
           acknowledgements, or (c) have their genuineness otherwise established
           to the satisfaction of the Trustee.

              The amount of Bonds payable to bearer, and the series and serial
           numbers thereof, held by a person executing an instrument of consent
           (or whose attorney has executed an instrument of consent in his
           behalf), and the date of his holding the same may be proved by
           exhibiting the Bonds to and obtaining a certificate executed by (i)
           any bank or trust or insurance company, or (ii) any trustee,
           secretary, administrator or other proper officer of any pension,
           welfare, hospitalization or similar fund or funds, or (iii) the
           United States of America, any Territory thereof, the District of
           Columbia, any State of the United States or any public
           instrumentality of the United States, or of any State or of any
           Territory, or (iv) any other person or corporation satisfactory to
           the Trustee.  A Bondholder in any of the foregoing categories may
           sign a certificate in his own behalf.

              Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state, in effect,
           that as of the date thereof, a coupon Bond or Bonds bearing a
           specified serial number or numbers was deposited with or exhibited to
           the signer of such certificate.  The holding by the person named in
           any such certificate of any Bond specified therein shall be presumed
           to continue unless (1) any certificate bearing a later date issued in
           respect of the same Bond shall be produced, (2)  the Bond specified
           in such certificate (or any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or
           substitution for such Bond) shall be produced by another holder, or
           (3) the Bond specified in such certificate shall be registered as to
           principal in the name of another holder or shall have been
           surrendered in exchange for a fully registered bond registered in the
           name of another holder.  The Trustee may nevertheless, in his
           discretion, require further proof in cases where it deems further
           proof desirable.  The ownership of registered Bonds shall be proved
           by the registry books.

               (C)  Until such time as the Trustee shall receive the written
             consent of the necessary per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds
             required by the provisions of subsection (A) above for action
             contemplated by such consent, any holder of a Bond, the serial
             number of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the
             Bonds the holders of which have consented to such action, may, by
             filing written notice with the Trustee at its principal office and
             upon proof of holding as provided in subsection (B) above, revoke
             such consent so far as it concerns such Bond.  Except as aforesaid,
             any such action taken by the holder of any Bond shall be conclusive
             and binding upon

                                      -25-
<PAGE>
 
           such holder and upon all future holders of such Bond (and any Bond
           issued in lieu thereof or exchanged therefor), irrespective of
           whether or not any notation of such consent is made upon such Bond,
           and in any event any action taken by the holders of the percentage in
           aggregate principal amount of the Bonds specified in subsection (A)
           above in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding
           upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Bonds."



                                 ARTICLE VIII.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings and earnings per share fluctuated due to many conditions, the primary
ones being: weather variations, electric rate reductions, sales growth,
fluctuating operating costs, the purchase and sales of utility properties, new
accounting requirements, lower interest expense, and changes in income and
property taxes.

The impacts of the more significant items affecting revenues, costs, and
earnings during the past several years are analyzed and discussed below.

</TABLE>

The increase in 1993 electric revenues primarily reflects the increase in
electricity sales from colder, more normal winter weather in the first quarter
1993 followed by warmer spring and summer weather when compared to 1992.  The
lower 1993 electric revenues due to rates reflect the November 1992 Missouri
rate settlement effective January 1, 1993, which decreased rates for all
Missouri electric customers and reduced annual revenues by approximately $42
million.  The sale of the Company's Iowa and northern Illinois retail properties
in December 1992 reduced 1993 electric revenues $52 million which was offset by
growth in other service areas, including the territory purchased from Arkansas
Power & Light Company in March 1992.

The decline in 1992 electric revenues was primarily due to unusually mild summer
weather which reduced air conditioning use as compared to 1991.  The unusually
warm spring and summer weather in 1991 resulted in significantly increased
electric revenues when compared to the weather experienced in 1990.  The lower
1991 electric revenues attributable to rate variations reflect lower rates
resulting from the Missouri rate design settlement, effective November 26, 1990.
Under the terms of this settlement, rate decreases for commercial and industrial
customers reduced revenues by approximately $30 million annually.

The variation in electric revenues attributable to growth and other factors in
1991, 1992, and 1993 primarily reflects differences in economic growth in the
Company's service territory for these periods.  In 1991, the Company's service
area experienced the general reduction in economic growth that occurred
nationally and was reflected in lower sales to industrial customers.  In 1991,
normalized kilowatthour sales decreased 0.4% compared to 1990.  In 1992,
normalized kilowatthour sales increased 3.2% compared to 1991, which reflects
both an improving local economy and the addition of new customers as a result of
the purchase of the Missouri distribution properties of Arkansas Power & Light
Company in March 1992.  In 1993, normalized kilowatthour sales decreased 0.8%
reflecting the loss of sales from the sale of the Company's Iowa and northern
Illinois service territory partially offset by an improved local economy.  Other
less significant factors contributing to variations in electric sales are
conservation, installation of energy efficient appliances, and changes to and
from alternative fuels.

</TABLE>

The increased 1993 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect increased purchased
power and lower generating efficiencies offset in part by greater hydro
generation and reduced steam generation.  Increased power purchases from other
utilities were required in 1993 when flooding interrupted coal deliveries to
several of the Company's fossil fueled power plants.  The decreased 1992 Fuel
and Purchased Power costs reflect reduced generation associated with lower
electric sales and a Callaway refueling outage in 1992, greater hydro generation
and lower fuel prices, offset in part by greater net purchased power costs.  The
increased 1991 Fuel and Purchased Power costs reflect increased steam plant
generation partly due to less hydro generation, reduced generating efficiencies,
and increased net purchased power costs, offset in part by decreased fuel
prices.

Other variations in 1991 through 1993 operating expenses  reflect recurring
conditions such as growth, inflation, and wage increases.  In 1993, operations
expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, increased $64 million,
primarily due to a $32 million increase in employee postretirement benefits
expense pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions", a $14
million increase in natural gas purchased for resale, a $5 million increase in
labor costs, and higher pensions, professional and computer services, regulatory
fees, and provision for injuries and damages.  In 

16   UNION ELECTRIC 1993
<PAGE>

1992, operations expenses, other than fuel and purchased power costs, increased
$7 million, primarily reflecting a $5 million increase in labor costs, a $4
million increase in employee benefit expenses, a $2 million increase in natural
gas purchased for resale, and a $1 million increase in tree trimming expense,
offset in part by a $5 million decrease in nuclear spent fuel disposal cost,
primarily due to the refueling outage at Callaway plant and a refund of
overcharges from the Department of Energy. In 1991, operations expenses, other
than fuel and purchased power costs, increased $8 million, due primarily to a $2
million increase in employee benefit expenses, a $3 million increase in
regulatory expenses, and a $2 million increase in natural gas purchased for
resale.

In 1993, maintenance expenses increased $3 million primarily due to flood-
related labor expenses.  In 1992, maintenance expenses increased $17 million,
due to a $20 million increase in Callaway plant maintenance expenses primarily
associated with Callaway's fifth refueling in early 1992, partially offset by
reduced maintenance at fossil-fueled generating plants.  In 1991, maintenance
expenses decreased $6 million, primarily due to a $14 million decrease in
Callaway plant maintenance expenses, reflecting the plant's fourth refueling in
late 1990, partially offset by higher tree trimming and storm-related
distribution expenses, and increased maintenance at most generating plants other
than Callaway.

Depreciation expense increased $6 million in 1993, due to increased depreciable
property.  Depreciation expense increased $10 million in 1992, primarily due to
the purchase of the Missouri distribution properties of Arkansas Power & Light
Company in early 1992, a $3 million increase in nuclear plant decommissioning
expense and increased other depreciable property.  Depreciation expense
increased $4 million in 1991 primarily due to increased depreciable property.

Income taxes from operations in 1993 reflect a higher federal income tax rate
offset by lower pre-tax income.  Income taxes from operations decreased $43
million in 1992 due principally to lower pre-tax income.  In 1991, income taxes
from operations increased $30 million due principally to higher pre-tax income.

In 1993, other taxes charged to operating expenses increased $6 million,
primarily due to higher gross receipts and real estate taxes.  In 1992, other
taxes charged to operating expenses increased $3 million due to a $7 million
increase in real estate taxes, partially offset by a $4 million reduction in
gross receipts taxes associated with lower revenues.  In 1991, other taxes
charged to operating expenses increased $3 million, due to a $2 million increase
in license and franchise taxes and a $1 million increase in payroll taxes.

INTEREST

In 1993, 1992 and 1991, interest expense decreased $6 million, $32 million and
$20 million, respectively, primarily due to the refinancing of high-cost debt
with lower cost issues, lower interest rates on variable rate debt and a
reduction in total debt outstanding.

CALLAWAY RATE PHASE-IN PLANS
See Note 1 under Notes to Financial Statements for information relative to
Callaway rate phase-in plans.
OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS

The 1993 increase in Miscellaneous of $4 million primarily reflects lower
miscellaneous income deductions.  The 1992 reduction in Miscellaneous of $3
million primarily reflects reduced charitable contributions and lower
miscellaneous income deductions.  The 1991 reduction in Miscellaneous of $13
million primarily reflects a reduction in interest income, greater charitable
contributions, the expense related to obtaining long-term power supply contracts
with certain wholesale customers, and other miscellaneous income deductions.
The December 1992 gain of $18 million, net of tax, from sales of electric
property, is discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources.

CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS

Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to reduce
total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by approximately two-thirds by the year
2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  With
switching to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company
anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
significant increase in revenue needs because the related capital costs,
estimated at about $300 million, will be largely offset by lower fuel costs.

CONTINGENCIES
See Note 10 under Notes to Financial Statements for issues existing at December
31, 1993 that could affect the Company.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Construction expenditures averaging approximately $310 million are anticipated
during each of the years 1994 through 1998.  The Company completed the
construction of its Callaway plant in late 1984.  Additional electric generation
capacity is not anticipated before the year 2000.  For funds required in
addition to construction expenditures, see Notes 2, 5, and 6 under Notes to
Financial Statements.

On March 12, 1992, the Company purchased the Missouri retail electric
distribution properties of Arkansas Power & Light Company (a subsidiary of
Entergy Corporation) for $63 million.  This acquisition increased the Company's
customers by 26,000 in 10 counties in southeastern

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(continued)

Missouri adjacent to the Company's existing service territory. In connection
with the transaction, the Company entered into a long-term power purchase
agreement with AP&L which allows the Company to serve the new customers cost-
effectively and without building additional generating capacity.

In December 1992, the Company sold its Iowa retail and wholesale electric
distribution properties to Iowa Electric Light & Power (a subsidiary of IES
Industries, Inc.) and its northern Illinois electric distribution properties to
Central Illinois Public Service Company.  The Company served approximately
21,000 customers in the areas sold.  The net book value of the properties sold
was $34 million.  Sales proceeds totaled $68 million.  As a result of these
sales, the Company realized a gain in 1992 of $18 million, net of tax.  The
Company's hydroelectric generating station near Keokuk, Iowa and related
transmission facilities were not included in the sales.

On January 24, 1994, the Company sold $100 million of first mortgage bonds, 7%
Series due 2024.  The Company used the proceeds to repay outstanding commercial
paper.

A nuclear fuel lease agreement provides financing for the Company's nuclear fuel
requirements.  Effective February 1, 1994, the maximum which can be financed
under the agreement was increased from $100 million to $120 million.  At
December 31, 1993, $99 million of nuclear fuel was financed under the lease.

The Company plans to continue utilizing short-term debt as support for normal
operations and other temporary requirements (see Note 3 under Notes to Financial
Statements).  The Company is authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to have outstanding at any one time up to $600 million of
short-term unsecured debt instruments.

TAX MATTERS

See Income Taxes in Note 7 under Notes to Financial Statement regarding SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Company's financial statements reflect the historical cost of events and
transactions occurring at times when the purchasing power of the dollar was
different.  The effects of inflation and changing prices on the Company's
financial statements are most significant in the areas of depreciation and
property, plant, and equipment.

The current replacement cost of the Company's utility plant substantially
exceeds its recorded historical cost.  However, the regulatory process limits
the Company to the recovery of the historical cost of utility plant through
depreciation.  While the regulatory process does not reflect the current cost of
replacing utility plant, past practice indicates the Company will be allowed to
earn on and to recover the increased cost of its net investment after facilities
are replaced.

The Company, by having assets such as receivables, fuel and materials inventory,
and deferred charges, incurs a loss of purchasing power during periods of
inflation because, after conversion, the cash received for these items will
purchase less.  More than offsetting such assets, however, are significant
amounts of long-term debt, deferred income taxes, and current liabilities which
will be paid with dollars of reduced purchasing power.

Net Income and Earnings on Common Stock for the fourth quarter of 1992 reflect a
gain of $18 million ($.18 per share) from the sale of the Company's Iowa and
northern Illinois retail distribution properties.  The Callaway plant was
refueled in the fourth quarter of 1993 and the second quarter of 1992, the
effect of which decreased earnings on common stock by about $21 million ($.20
per share) in each of these quarters.  The cost of flooding in the Company's
service territory in 1993 reduced earnings on common stock by $10 million ($.10
per share), primarily in the third quarter.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors             February 2, 1994
of Union Electric Company

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
income, long-term debt, preferred stock, retained earnings, other paid-in
capital, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Union Electric Company at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

(a)  At December 31, 1993, substantially all of the property and plant was
     mortgaged under, and subject to liens of, the respective indentures
     pursuant to which the bonds were issued.
(b)  Redeemed in 1993.
(c)  Environmental Improvement Series.
(d)  A bank credit agreement due 1995 permits the Company to borrow up to $200

     Company's selection of various options under the agreement. At December 31,
     1993, no such borrowings were outstanding. 
(e)  A bank credit agreement due 1996 is utilized to support commercial paper
     borrowings up to $300 million on a long-term basis. At December 31, 1993,
     the outstanding commercial paper was at an average annualized interest rate
     of 3.22%.
(f)  Adjustable-fixed rate, interest rate at 2.65% per annum through May 31,
     1994; thereafter, interest rates will depend on market conditions and the
     Company's selection of an adjusted rate for each annual period or a fixed
     rate until maturity.
(g)  Interest rates and the periods during which such rates apply, vary
     depending on the Company's selection of certain defined rate modes. The
     average interest rates at December 31, 1993, for 1985 Series A, 1985 Series
     B, 1991 Series and 1992 Series bonds were 2.49%, 2.48%, 2.65% and 2.92%,
     respectively.

     bonds, 7% Series due 2024.
(j)  The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 is
     $1,868,626,000. This estimate is based primarily on market values of actual
     or comparable securities at year end. The estimate may not represent actual
     values of financial instruments that could have been realized as of year
     end or that may be realized in the future.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                             UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY

NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission, Illinois
Commerce Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The
accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with the rate-making
practices of the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction and, as such,
conform to generally accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated
public utilities.  Following is a description of the Company's significant
accounting policies:

PROPERTY AND PLANT

The cost of additions to and betterments of units of property and plant is
capitalized.  Cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, and overheads,
plus an allowance for funds used during construction.  Maintenance expenditures
and the renewal of items not considered units of property are charged to income
as incurred.  When units of depreciable property are retired, the original cost
and removal cost, less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various classes of
depreciable property by applying composite rates on a straight-line basis.  The
provision for depreciation in 1993, 1992, and 1991 was approximately 3% of the
average depreciable cost.

NUCLEAR FUEL

The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a unit-of-production
basis.  Spent fuel disposal cost is charged to expense based on kilowatthours
sold.

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of
transactions that have been treated differently for financial reporting and tax
return purposes, measured using statutory tax rates.

Investment tax credits utilized in prior years were deferred and are being
amortized over the useful lives of the properties to which they relate.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION

Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC) is a utility industry
accounting practice whereby the cost of borrowed funds and the cost of equity
funds (preferred and common stockholders' equity) applicable to the Company's
construction program are capitalized as a cost of construction.  This
accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of financing
current construction, and treats such financing costs in the same manner as
construction charges for labor and materials.

Under accepted rate-making practice, cash recovery of AFC, as well as other
construction costs, occurs when completed projects are placed in service and
reflected in customer rates.

AFC rates are established by the Company consistent with  the methodology
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Average annual AFC rates
were 7.8% in 1993, 6.2% in 1992, and 7.1% in 1991.

CALLAWAY RATE PHASE-IN PLANS

The Callaway rate phase-in plans effective in 1985 as a result of regulatory
commission orders provided for the partial deferral of a cash recovery of costs
related to the Callaway plant during the early years of the plans with recovery
of such deferrals in the later years of the plans.

A 1987 order of the Missouri Public Service Commission provided that $159
million of deferred costs at December 31, 1987, applicable to Missouri be
recovered in rates over the five years 1988 through 1992.

UNBILLED REVENUE

The Company accrues on its books estimated, but unbilled, revenue and also a
liability for the related taxes.

NOTE 2 -- DEBT RETIREMENT PROVISIONS

During the five years from December 31, 1993, the amounts of debt maturities
totaling $174 million are: $31 million in 1994; $38 million in 1995; $60 million
in 1996; and $45 million in 1997.  Amounts for years subsequent to 1994 do not
include nuclear fuel lease payments since the amounts of such payments are not
currently determinable.

Debt retirement provisions contained in some mortgage    bond indentures of the
Company require, subject to certain alternatives, the redemption annually of 1%
of the principal amount (as defined) of each series of bonds. In substantially
all instances, as permitted by the indentures, the Company has been pledging
property additions in lieu of such redemptions.

                                                                              27
<PAGE>
 
NOTE 3 -- SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
Short-term borrowings of the Company consist of bank loans (maturities generally
on an overnight basis) and commercial paper (maturities generally within 10-45
days). Information relative to short-term borrowings is as follows:

borrowings shown above.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had committed bank lines of credit aggregating
$187 million ($162 million of which were unused at such date) which make
available interim financing at various rates of interest based on  LIBOR, the
bank certificate of deposit rate, or other options, and in support of which the
Company has agreements with its lending banks to pay annual fees up to 0.125%.
These lines of credit are renewable annually at various dates throughout the
year.

NOTE 4 -- NUCLEAR FUEL LEASE
The Company has a lease agreement which provides for the financing of nuclear
fuel.  Effective February 1, 1994, the maximum amount which may be financed
under the agreement was increased from $100 million to $120 million. Pursuant to
the terms of the lease, the Company has assigned to the lessor certain contracts
for purchase of nuclear fuel. The lessor obtains, through the issuance of
commercial paper or from direct loans under a committed revolving credit
agreement from commercial banks, the necessary funds to purchase the fuel and
make interest payments when due.

The Company is obligated to reimburse the lessor for all expenditures for
nuclear fuel, interest, and related costs. Obligations under this lease become
due as the nuclear fuel is consumed at the Company's Callaway nuclear plant.
The Company reimbursed the lessor $55.0 million during 1993, $54.3 million
during 1992, and $68.0 million during 1991.

The Company has capitalized the cost, including certain   interest costs, of the
leased nuclear fuel and has recorded

the related lease obligation.  During the years 1993, 1992, and 1991, the total
interest charges under the lease were $3.1 million, $4.4 million, and $8.5
million (based on average interest rates of 3.6%, 4.3%, and 6.7%, respectively)
of which $1.4 million, $1.3 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, were
capitalized.

NOTE 5 -- PREFERRED STOCK
During the three years ended December 31, 1993, preferred stock, without par
value, was issued or redeemed as follows: issued 1,657,500 shares, $1.735 Series
and 330,000 shares, $7.64 Series in 1993; redeemed 350,000 shares, $8.00 Series

NOTE 7 -- INCOME TAXES

Total income tax expense for 1993 resulted in an effective tax rate of 38% on
earnings before income taxes (39% in 1992 and 41% in 1991).  The principal
reasons such rates differ from the statutory Federal rate are as follows:

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes."  Prior to 1993, in accordance with accepted ratemaking practice,
deferred income taxes were not provided for certain temporary differences flowed
through to customers and the equity component of Allowance for Funds Used During
Construction.  SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of the income tax effect of
such temporary differences.  Accordingly, a Regulatory Asset, representing the
probable recovery from customers of future income taxes which is expected to
occur when the temporary differences reverse, has been recorded along with a
corresponding deferred tax liability.  Also, a Regulatory Liability recognizing
the lower expected revenue resulting from reduced income taxes associated with
amortizing accumulated deferred investment tax credits, has been recorded.  The
deferred tax asset corresponding to this Regulatory Liability has been combined
with the deferred tax liabilities.

SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax liabilities be adjusted for enacted
changes in tax laws or rates.  Accordingly, the Company reduced its deferred tax
liabilities for amounts previously recorded in excess of the current statutory
rate.  Recognizing that regulators will probably reduce future revenues for
these excess tax deferrals, the reduction in the deferred tax liability was
credited to the Regulatory Liability.

Adopting SFAS No. 109 increased both assets and liabilities at December 31, 1993
by approximately $762 million, but did not affect the Company's 1993 earnings on
common stock.

Under SFAS No. 109, temporary differences gave rise to deferred tax assets of
$40 million and deferred tax liabilities of $1.43 billion at December 31, 1993.
These are sum-marized as follows (in millions):

NOTE 8 -- RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company has non-contributory, defined-benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all of its employees. Benefits are based on the employees' years
of service and  compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute
annually at least the minimum amount required by government funding standards,
but not more than can be deducted for Federal income taxes. Plan assets consist
principally of common stocks and fixed income securities.
Pension costs for the years 1993, 1992, and 1991, were $27 million, $25 million,
and $24 million, respectively, of which approximately 18% in 1993 and 1992, and
17% in 1991 were charged to construction accounts.

For determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
in 1993, 1992, and 1991, the weighted average discount rates were 7.25%, 8.5%,
and 8.75%, respectively.  The rate of increase in future compensation was 4.25%
in 1993, and 6% in 1992 and 1991.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets was 8.5%.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.  Substantially all of
the Company's employees may become eligible for those benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for the Company.  Prior to 1993, the costs of
retiree health care and life insurance benefits were recognized on the basis of
claims paid.  For 1993, 1992, and 1991, the actual claims paid were $14.6
million, $13.5 million, and $11 million, respectively.

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions," which requires accrual of
expected postretirement benefit costs during employees' years of service.  The
present value of the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is
estimated to be $325 million and the 1993 net periodic postretirement benefit
costs were $53 million, of which approximately 18% was charged to construction
accounts.  The Company's transition obligation is being amortized over 20 years.

Assumptions for the obligation and expense measurements are
as follows:

DISCOUNT RATE AT MEASUREMENT DATE                                  7.25%
MEDICAL COST TREND RATE - INITIAL                                 11.25%
                        - ULTIMATE                                 5.25%
ULTIMATE MEDICAL COST TREND RATE EXPECTED IN YEAR                  2000
</TABLE>

A one percent increase in the medical cost trend rate is estimated to increase
the net periodic cost and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $4 million and $28 million, respectively.

In January 1993, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board established the criteria permitting regulated enterprises to
record a regulatory asset offsetting the liability recorded pursuant to SFAS
106.  The prescribed criteria preclude the Company from recording a regulatory
asset.  As a result, adopting SFAS 106 reduced the Company's 1993 earnings on
common stock by $20 million or 20 cents per share.

NOTE 9 -- CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENTS
The Company is engaged in a construction program under which expenditures
averaging approximately $310 million are anticipated during each of the next
five years.

NOTE 10 -- CONTINGENCIES
The Company's insurance coverage for its Callaway plant is as follows:

  Property insurance coverage of $500 million provided by American Nuclear
  Insurers (ANI) and Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters (MAELU).

  Excess property insurance of $850 million, including $100 million of coverage
  for premature decom-missioning costs, provided by ANI/MAELU and Nuclear
  Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established by the utility
  industry.

  Excess property insurance of $1.15 billion pro-vided by NEIL.  Under this
  policy, the Company could be subject to a maximum retrospective premium
  assessment of $11.6 million in any one policy year.  The policy also provides
  up to an additional $250 million of coverage for premature decommissioning
  costs in excess of funds previously collected for decommissioning.  Such
  coverage is limited to a premature decom-missioning which results from a major
  accident.

  The NRC requires property insurance proceeds to be first dedicated to reactor
  stabilization and decontamination, which may significantly reduce the proceeds
  available for property repair and replacement.

  A Master Worker Policy issued by ANI/MAELU with an aggregate limit of $400
  million for the nuclear industry as a whole to cover claims of workers as a
  result of initial radiation exposure after December 31, 1987. Under this
  policy, the Company could be subject to a maximum retrospective premium
  assessment of $3.1 million.

  Accidental outage replacement power cost insurance provided by NEIL.
  Thereunder, the Company is insured for up to $3.1 million per week for the
  first year, commencing 21 weeks after initiation of the outage and up to $2.1
  million per week for the second and third year.  Under this policy, the
  Company could be subject to a maximum annual retrospective premium assessment
  of $3.3 million in any one policy year.

The Atomic Energy Act, as revised August 1988 by the Price-Anderson amendments,
covers liability to third parties for a nuclear incident and, at December 31,
1993, limited such liability to approximately $9.4 billion for each nuclear
incident.  Coverage of the first $200 million of liability is provided by
ANI/MAELU.  The balance is provided by utility industry retrospective
assessments.  The Company's maximum potential assessment under this plan would
be $75.5 million per incident payable in annual installments of not more than
$10 million.  Additionally, if the sum of all public liability claims and legal
costs arising from a nuclear incident exceeds the amount of primary and excess
coverage in force, the Company can be assessed an additional $3.8 million.  As
required by the Price-Anderson Act, the assessment is subject to an inflationary
adjustment.

To the extent that any losses arising from a nuclear incident at Callaway plant
exceed the limits of, or are not subject to, insurance, or to the extent such
insurance becomes unavailable in the future, the Company may retain the risk of
loss as a self-insurer.  Although the Company has no reason to anticipate a
serious nuclear incident at Callaway plant, if such an incident did occur, it
could have a material but presently undeterminable adverse effect on the
Company's financial position.

Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Company is required to reduce
total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by approximately two-thirds by the year
2000.  Significant reductions in nitrogen oxide will also be required.  With
switching to low-sulfur coal and early banking of emission credits, the Company
anticipates that it can comply with the requirements of the law with no
significant increase in revenue needs because the related capital costs,
estimated at about $300 million, will be largely offset by lower fuel costs.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company was designated a potentially responsible
party (PRP) by federal and state environmental protection agencies for five
hazardous waste sites.  Other hazardous waste sites have been identified for
which the Company may be responsible but has not been designated a PRP.  The
Company is continuing to evaluate the remediation costs that will be required
for all of these sites.  However, such costs are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

The Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various
courts and agencies with

                                                                              31

respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which
involve substantial amounts. Management is of the opinion that the final
disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position.

In November 1992, the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) approved a
settlement among various parties involving the Company's Missouri electric
rates.  Under the terms of the settlement, rate decreases for all classes of
Missouri electric customers reduced 1993 annual revenues by approximately $42
million.  The settlement also provides that no party shall file for a general
increase or decrease in the Company's Missouri electric rates prior to September
1, 1994, except that the Company may request an increase if certain adverse
events occur.

See Management's Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources for
information regarding the Company's acquisition and sales of electric
properties.

NOTE 11 -- CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
DOE currently charges one mill per kilowatthour sold for future disposal of
spent fuel.  Electric rates charged to customers provide for recovery of such
costs.  DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage facility for spent
fuel available until at least 2010.  The Company has sufficient storage capacity
at the Callaway plant site until 2005 and has viable storage alternatives under
consideration that would provide additional storage facilities.  Each
alternative will likely require Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval and may
require other regulatory approvals.  The delayed availability of DOE's disposal
facility is not expected to adversely affect the continued operation of the
Callaway plant.

In 1993, the Company recorded a $23 million liability and a corresponding asset
for a special DOE assessment on all utilities owning nuclear plants.  The
assessment is for the future decontamination, decommissioning and reclamation of
DOE uranium enrichment facilities.  It will be paid and charged to expense over
15 years beginning in 1993.

Callaway plant decommissioning costs are estimated to be $372 million in current
year dollars. Annual decom-missioning costs are charged to depreciation expense
over Callaway's service life and amounted to $6.7 million in 1993.  Electric
rates charged to customers provide for recovery of decommissioning costs over
the life of the plant, based on an assumed 40-year life, ending upon expiration
of the plant's operating license in 2024.  Every three years, the MoPSC requires
the Company to file updated cost studies for decommissioning Callaway.  Electric
rates may be adjusted at such times to reflect changes in cost estimates.
Amounts collected from customers are deposited in a trust fund established to
provide for decommissioning costs.  Fund earnings, net of expenses, appear on
the balance sheet as increases in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and in
the Accumulated Provision for Nuclear Decommissioning.  The Callaway site is
assumed to be decommissioned using the DECON (immediate dismantlement)
alternative.
