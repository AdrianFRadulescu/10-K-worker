                                   PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

  URS Corporation (the "Company") offers a broad range of planning, design
and program and construction management services for engineering,
architectural and environmental projects.  The Company serves public and
private sector clients throughout the United States in two principal markets:
infrastructure projects involving transportation systems, institutional and
commercial facilities and water resources; and environmental projects
involving hazardous waste management and pollution control.

  The Company conducts its business through 24 offices located throughout the
United States.  The Company has approximately 1,100 full-time employees, many
of whom hold advanced or technical degrees and have extensive experience in
sophisticated disciplines applicable to the Company's business.  The Company
believes that its geographic and technical diversity allow it to compete for
local, regional and national projects, and enable it to apply to each project
a variety of resources from its national network.

                                  Services
                                  --------

  The Company provides professional services in three major areas:  planning,
design and program and construction management through the Company's
24 offices.  Each of these offices is responsible for obtaining local or
regional contracts.  This approach allows regional government agencies and
private clients to view the Company's offices as local businesses with
superior service delivery capabilities.  Because the Company can draw from
its large and diverse network of professional and technical resources, the
Company has the capability to market and perform large, multi-state projects.

Planning
- --------

  Planning covers a broad range of assignments, ranging from conceptual
design and technical and economic feasibility studies to community
involvement programs.  Planning services also involve developing alternative
concepts for project implementation and analyzing the impacts of each
alternative.

  In addition to traditional engineering and architectural planning services,
the Company has extensive expertise in a number of highly specialized areas,
including toll facilities, health care facility renovation, environmental
site analysis, water quality planning for urban storm water management and
site remediation assignments.


                              Page 2 of 90                             <PAGE>

Design
- ------

  The Company's professionals provide a broad range of design and
design-related services, including computerized mapping, architectural and
interior design, civil, sanitary and geotechnical engineering, process design
and seismic (earthquake) analysis and design.  For each project, the Company
identifies the project requirements and then integrates and coordinates the
various design elements.  The result is a set of contract documents that may
include plans, specifications and cost estimates that are used to build a
project.  These documents detail design characteristics and set forth for the
contractor the materials which should be used and the schedule for
construction.  Other critical tasks in the design process may include value
analysis and the assessment of construction and maintenance requirements.

Program and Construction Management
- -----------------------------------

  The Company's program and construction management services include master
scheduling of both the design and construction phases, construction and
life-cycle cost estimating, cash flow analysis, value engineering,
constructability reviews and bid management.  Once construction has begun,
the Company supervises and coordinates the activities of the construction
contractor.  This frequently involves acting as the owner's representative
for on-site supervision and inspection of the contractor's work.  In this
role, the Company's objective is to monitor a project's schedule, cost and
quality.  The Company generally does not take contractual responsibility for
the contractor's risks and methods, nor for site safety conditions.

                                   Markets
                                   -------
  The Company's strategy is to focus on two major markets:  infrastructure
projects involving transportation systems, institutional and commercial
facilities and water resources; and environmental projects involving
hazardous waste management and pollution control.  The Company has developed
a nationwide identity based on its successful completion of a number of
highly visible rehabilitation and expansion projects in these markets. 
Although the Company views these markets as being distinct, the Company
provides its planning, design and program and construction management
services to both markets.

Infrastructure
- --------------

  The Company has significant expertise in three areas relating to the
infrastructure market: transportation systems, institutional and commercial
facilities and water resources projects.

                              Page 3 of 90                             <PAGE>

  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  The Company's engineers, designers, planners and
managers provide services for projects involving all types of transportation
networks, such as highways, roadways, streets, bridges, rapid and mass
transit systems, airports and marine facilities.  These services range from
the design of interstate highways to harbor traffic simulation studies and
may extend from conceptual planning through preliminary and final design to
construction management.  Historically, the Company's emphasis in this area
has been on the design of new transportation facilities, but in recent years
the rehabilitation of existing facilities has become a major focus.
 
  INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES.  The Company provides
architectural, engineering design, space planning and construction
supervision services to this market.  Demand for low-maintenance, energy
efficient facilities drive today's market for commercial and industrial
buildings.  In addition, there is increased pressure to renovate facilities
to meet changing needs and current building standards.

  WATER RESOURCES.  The Company's capabilities in this market include the
planning, design and program and construction management of water supply,
storage, distribution and treatment systems, as well as work in basin plans,
groundwater supply, customer rate studies, urban run-off, bond issues, flood
control, water quality analysis and beach erosion control.

Environmental
- -------------
  The Company has developed expertise in two principal environmental markets: 
hazardous waste management and pollution control.

  HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT.  The Company conducts initial site
investigations, designs remedial actions for site clean-up and provides
construction management services during site clean-up.  This market involves
identifying and developing measures to effectively dispose of hazardous and
toxic waste at contaminated sites.  The Company also provides air quality
monitoring and designs individual facility modifications required to meet
local, state and Federal air quality standards.  This work requires
specialized knowledge of and compliance with complex Federal and state
regulations, as well as the permitting and approval processes.  Solid waste
management services provided by the Company include facility siting, transfer
station design and community-wide master planning.

  The Company has been awarded several significant contracts with government
agencies, including a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for
environmental engineering and remediation work in the Northwest and Alaska
under the Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action-Navy ("Navy CLEAN")
program and two contracts with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") under its Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy ("EPA ARCS")
program.  Under the Navy CLEAN contract, the Company provides site
inspections, site characterizations, remediation designs and action plans for
contaminated Navy facilities.  A portion of the Navy CLEAN contract, which is
expected to have a ten-year term, is awarded each year over the life of the
contract.  In fiscal 1993 and 1992, the Company generated revenues associated
with the Navy CLEAN contract of $22.1 million and $29.3 million,
respectively.  The Company's services under the ten year EPA ARCS contracts
include investigating the nature and extent of contamination by hazardous
materials, performing risk assessments, evaluating the feasibility of various
options for remedial action and providing management, technical, quality
assurance and health and safety reviews of potentially responsible party
submittals.  Work under the EPA ARCS contracts is performed on a task order

                              Page 4 of 90                             <PAGE>

basis.  In fiscal 1993 and 1992, the Company recognized revenues of $16.5
million and $12.4 million, respectively, under the EPA ARCS contracts.

  POLLUTION CONTROL.  The Company's principal services in this market include
the planning and design of new wastewater facilities, such as sewer systems
and wastewater treatment plants, and the analysis and expansion of existing
systems.  The types of work performed by the Company include infiltration/
inflow studies, combined sewer overflow studies, water quality facilities
planning projects and design and construction management services for
wastewater treatment plants.

                                   Clients
                                   -------
General
- -------
  The Company's clients include local, state and Federal government agencies
and private sector businesses.  Since 1989, revenues from Federal government
projects have increased as a percentage of the Company's total revenues.  The
Company's revenues from local, state and Federal government agencies and
private businesses for the last five fiscal years are as follows:

Contract Pricing and Terms of Engagement
- ----------------------------------------
  Under its cost-plus contracts, the Company charges clients negotiated rates
based on the Company's direct and indirect costs.  Labor costs and
subcontractor services are the principal components of the Company's direct
costs.  Federal Acquisition Regulations limit the recovery of certain
specified indirect costs on contracts subject to such regulations .  In
negotiating a cost-plus contract, the Company estimates all recoverable
direct and indirect costs and then adds a profit component, which is either a
percentage of total recoverable costs or a fixed negotiated fee, to arrive at
a total dollar estimate for the project.  The Company receives payment based
on the total actual number of labor hours expended.  If the actual total
number of labor hours is lower than estimated, the revenues from that project
will be lower than estimated.  If the actual labor hours expended exceed the
initial negotiated amount, the Company must obtain a contract modification in
order to receive payment for such overage.  The Company's profit margin will
increase to the extent the Company is able to reduce actual costs below the
estimates used to produce the negotiated fixed prices on contracts not
covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations; conversely, the Company's profit
margin will decrease and the Company may realize a loss on the project if the
Company does not control costs and exceeds the overall estimates used to
produce the negotiated price.

  Cost-plus contracts covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations require an
audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if
actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs.  The Defense
Contract Audit Agency, auditors for the Department of Defense and other
Federal agencies, has completed incurred cost audits of the Company's Federal
contracts for fiscal years ended through October 31, 1986, resulting in
immaterial adjustments.  The Company does not anticipate significant contract
adjustments or other government action resulting from government audits of
the years 1987 through 1993.

  Under its fixed-price contracts, the Company receives an agreed sum
negotiated in advance for the specified scope of work.  Under fixed-price
contracts, no payment adjustments are made if the Company over-estimates or
under-estimates the number of labor hours required to complete the project,
unless there is a change of scope in the work to be performed.  Accordingly,
the Company's profit margin will increase to the extent the number of labor
hours and other costs are below the contracted amounts.  The profit margin
will decrease and the Company may realize a loss on the project if the number
of labor hours required and other costs exceed the estimates.

Backlog, Project Designations and Indefinite Delivery Contracts
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  The Company's contract backlog was $142.0 million at October 31, 1993,
compared to $123.5 million at October 31, 1992.  The Company's contract
backlog consists of the amount billable at a particular point in time for
future services under executed, funded contracts.  Indefinite delivery
contracts, which are executed contracts requiring the issuance of task
orders, are included in contract backlog only to the extent the task orders
are actually issued and funded.  Of the contract backlog of $142.0 million at
October 31, 1993, approximately 30%, or $43 million, is not reasonably
expected to be filled within the next fiscal year ending October 31, 1994.

  The Company has also been designated by customers as the recipient of
certain future contracts.  These "designations" are projects that have been
awarded to the Company but for which contracts have not yet been executed. 

                              Page 6 of 90                             <PAGE>

Task orders under executed indefinite delivery contracts which are expected
to be issued in the immediate future are included in designations.  Total
contract designations were estimated to be $213.6 million at October 31,
1993, as compared to $154.8 million at October 31, 1992.  Typically, a
significant portion of designations are converted into signed contracts. 
However, there is no assurance this will continue to occur in the future.

  Indefinite delivery contracts are signed contracts where work is performed
only when specific task orders are issued by the client.  Generally these
contracts exceed one year and often indicate a maximum term and potential
value.  Examples of such contracts are the Navy CLEAN and EPA ARCs contracts. 
Certain indefinite delivery contracts are for a definite time period with
renewal option periods at the client's discretion.  While the Company
believes that it will continue to get work under these contracts over their
entire term, because of renewals and the necessity for issuance of individual
task orders, continued work by the Company and the realization of their
potential maximum values under these contracts is not assured.

  However, because of the increasing frequency with which the Company's
government and private sector clients use this contracting method, the
Company believes their potential value should be disclosed along with backlog
and designations as an indicator of the Company's future business.  When the
client notifies the Company of the scope and pricing of task orders, the
estimated value of such task orders are added to designations.  When such
task orders are signed and funded, their value goes into backlog.  At
October 31, 1993, the potential value of the Company's five largest
indefinite delivery contracts was as follows:

                                 Competition
                                 -----------

  The engineering and architectural services industry is highly fragmented
and very competitive.  As a result, in each specific market area the Company
competes with many engineering and consulting firms, several of which are
substantially larger than the Company and which possess greater financial
resources.  No firm currently dominates any significant portion of the
Company's markets.

  Competition is based on quality of service, expertise, price, reputation
and local presence.  The Company believes that it competes favorably with
respect to each of these factors in the markets it serves.

                                  Employees
                                  ---------

  The Company has approximately 1,100 full-time employees, many of whom hold
advanced or technical degrees and have extensive experience in a variety of
disciplines applicable to the Company's business.  The Company also employs,
at various times on a temporary basis, up to several hundred additional
persons to meet contractual requirements.  None of the Company's employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The Company has never
experienced a strike or work stoppage.  The Company believes that employee
relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

  The Company leases office space in 24 locations throughout the United
States.  Most of the leases are written for a minimum term of three years
with options for renewal, sublease rights and allowances for improvements. 
Significant lease agreements expire at various dates through the year 2002. 
The Company believes that its current facilities are sufficient for the
operation of its business and that suitable additional space in various local
markets is available to accommodate any needs that may arise.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                            Results of Operations

Fiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992
- -------------------------------------
  Revenues in fiscal 1993 were $145.8 million, or 7% over the amount reported
in fiscal 1992.  The growth in revenues is primarily attributable to
increases in revenues derived from all areas of the Company's business,
particularly transportation and other infrastructure projects in the
Northeast.  Revenues generated from the Company's three largest contracts;
Navy CLEAN; EPA ARCS 9&10; and EPA ARCS 6, 7, & 8, decreased slightly in
fiscal 1993 to $38.5 million as compared to $41.7 million in fiscal 1992. 
The decrease in revenues from these contracts is primarily due to a decrease
in the number of task orders for hazardous waste services on the Navy CLEAN
contract.  Revenues generated from private commercial businesses decreased
from $18.9 million in fiscal 1992 to $16.7 million in fiscal 1993.

  Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and direct
expenses, including subcontractor costs, increased $6.1 million, or 7%, over
the amount reported in fiscal 1992.  The increase is due to an overall
increase in the Company's business in fiscal 1993 as compared to fiscal 1992. 
Indirect general and administrative expenses ("IG&A") increased to
$51.6 million in fiscal 1993 from $45.5 million in fiscal 1992.  Expressed as
a percentage of revenues, IG&A expenses increased from 33% in fiscal 1992 to
35% in fiscal 1993.   The increase in IG&A expenses is primarily attributable
to the overall increase in the Company's business and to the one-time charge
of $2.0 million taken in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 in connection with
the planned phase-out of certain of the Company's architectural offices and
for claims on certain of the Company's architectural projects.  To a lesser
extent, IG&A expenses increased due to program delays experienced in
connection with certain of the Company's contracts.  Net interest expense
remained relatively constant at $1.2 million in fiscal 1993.


                              Page 14 of 90                            <PAGE>

  The Company earned $1.4 million before income taxes in fiscal 1993 compared
to $4.7 million in fiscal 1992.  While the Company has available net
operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes, for state
income tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily available to offset
income subject to tax.  Accordingly, the Company's effective tax rate for
fiscal 1993 was approximately 10%.

  Net income decreased to $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 as compared to
$4.3 million in fiscal 1992.  The Company earned $.18 per share in fiscal
1993 compared to $.55 per share in fiscal 1992.

  The Company's backlog of signed and funded contracts at October 31, 1993
was $142.0 million, as compared to $123.5 million at October 31, 1992.  The
value of the Company's designations, which are awarded projects for which
contracts have not been signed, was $213.6 million at October 31, 1993, as
compared to $154.8 million at October 31, 1992.

Fiscal 1992 Compared with Fiscal 1991
- -------------------------------------
  Revenues in fiscal 1992 grew to $136.8 million, or 11% over the amount
reported in fiscal 1991.  The growth in revenues is primarily attributable to
increases in revenues generated from the Company's three largest contracts;
Navy CLEAN; EPA ARCS 9 & 10; and EPA ARCS 6, 7 & 8.  Combined revenues on
these contracts were $41.7 million in fiscal 1992 compared to $25.5 million
in fiscal 1991.  The increase in revenues from these contracts is due to an
increase in the number of task orders for hazardous waste clean-up services. 
Revenues generated from private commercial businesses increased marginally to
$18.9 million from $18.5 million in fiscal 1991.

  Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and direct
expenses, including subcontractor costs, increased $12.7 million, or 17% over
the amount reported in fiscal 1991.  The increase is due to a greater volume
of subcontractor and outside laboratory services related to the Navy CLEAN
and EPA ARCS contracts in fiscal 1992.  Conversely, while revenues increased
by 11%, IG&A expenses remained relatively constant at $45 million.  Expressed
as a percentage of revenues, IG&A expenses decreased from 37% in fiscal 1991
to 33% in fiscal 1992.  The Company attributes this decrease to continued
emphasis on cost controls.  Net interest expense decreased from $2.3 million
in fiscal 1991 to $1.2 million in fiscal 1992 due to significantly lower debt
levels in fiscal 1992 as the result of the secondary common stock offering
completed by the Company in June 1991.

  The Company earned $4.7 million before income taxes in fiscal 1992 compared
to $2.5 million in fiscal 1991.  While the Company has available net
operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes, for state
income tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily available to offset
income subject to tax.  Accordingly, the Company's effective tax rate for
fiscal 1992 was approximately 10%.

                              Page 15 of 90                            <PAGE>

  Net income increased 86% to $4.3 million, compared to $2.3 million in
fiscal 1991.  The Company earned $.55 per share in fiscal 1992 compared to
$.38 per share in fiscal 1991.

  The Company's backlog of signed and funded contracts at October 31, 1992
was $123.5 million, as compared to $120.6 million at October 31, 1991.  The
value of the Company's designations, which are awarded projects for which
contracts have not been signed, was $154.8 million at October 31, 1992, as
compared to $101.4 million at October 31, 1991.

Income Taxes
- ------------
  Prior to October 10, 1989, the Company had available net operating loss
("NOL") carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately
$51 million.  As a result of a change in ownership as defined by Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") that occurred on October 10, 1989, the
Company's NOL carryforwards for financial statement and Federal income tax
purposes became limited to approximately $750,000 per year for the succeeding
fifteen-year carryforward period, for an aggregate of $11.2 million, plus NOL
attributable to recognized built-in gains, limited to $14 million by IRC
Section 382, for a total of $25.2 million.  The financial statement tax
benefits arising from these NOL carryforwards will be recognized as a
reduction in financial statement tax expense and an addition to paid-in
capital in the years utilized.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had utilized
$8.0 million of the total $25.2 million for Federal income tax purposes and
$8.1 million for financial statement purposes.

                       Liquidity and Capital Resources
                       -------------------------------

  The Company's liquidity and capital measurements are set forth below:

    In October 1992, the Company amended its existing line of credit
agreement with Wells Fargo Bank (the "Bank").  The amended line of credit,
which is secured by all the assets of the Company, provides for advances up
to $10,000,000 and expires April 29, 1994.  Borrowings on the line of credit
bear interest at the Bank's prime rate plus one-half percent payable monthly
in arrears.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had $9,829,000 available to it
under the line of credit.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding
letters of credit totalling $171,000 which reduced the amount available to
the Company under the line of credit.



                              Page 16 of 90                            <PAGE>

    Under the amended Bank line of credit agreement, the Company is required
to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants.  The Company was in
compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants related to the line
of credit agreement at October 31, 1993 and October 31, 1992.

    The Company is a professional services organization and as such, is not
capital intensive.  Capital expenditures during fiscal years 1993, 1992 and
1991 were $1,952,000, $1,158,000 and $1,004,000, respectively.  The
expenditures were principally for computer aided design and drafting
equipment and facilities expansion to accommodate the Company's growth.  The
Company expects fiscal 1994 capital expenditures to be comparable to the
expenditures in fiscal 1993.

    The Company believes that its existing financial resources, together with
its planned cash flow from operations and its unused Bank line of credit,
will provide sufficient capital to fund its operations in fiscal 1994.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
- -----------------------------------------------------
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of URS
Corporation and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
  Revenue from contract services is recognized by the percentage-of-
completion method and includes a proportion of the earnings expected to be
realized on a contract in the ratio that costs incurred bear to estimated
total costs.  Revenue on cost reimbursable contracts is recorded as related
contract costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees in the
proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs.  The
fees under certain government contracts may be increased or decreased in
accordance with cost or performance incentive provisions which measure actual
performance against established targets or other criteria.  Such incentive
fee awards or penalties are included in revenue at the time the amounts can
be reasonably determined. Revenue for additional contract compensation
related to unpriced change orders is recorded when realization is probable. 
Revenue from claims by the Company for additional contract compensation is
recorded when agreed to by the customer.  If estimated total costs on any
contract indicate a loss, the Company provides currently for the total loss
anticipated on the contract.

  Costs under contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to government
audit upon contract completion.  Therefore, all contract costs, including
direct, indirect, and general and administrative expenses, are potentially
subject to adjustment prior to final reimbursement.  Management believes that
adequate provision for such adjustments, if any, has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.  All overhead and general and
administrative expense recovery rates for fiscal 1987 through fiscal 1993 are
subject to review by the U.S. Government.

Income Taxes
- ------------
  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96,
deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future
years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts.  Investment tax credits are treated as a
reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the related assets are
acquired.


                              Page 23 of 90                            <PAGE>

  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes ("SFAS 109") will be effective for the Company in fiscal 1994.  The
Company believes that the implementation of the new standard will not have a
material affect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Depreciation and Amortization
- -----------------------------
  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful
service lives of the assets.  Goodwill is amortized on the straight-line
method ranging from 10 to 20 years.

Income Per Share
- ----------------
  Primary earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding, warrants and on shares issuable under stock
options that have a dilutive affect (shares used in such calculations were
6,742,000 in 1991, 8,221,000 in 1992 and 6,971,000 in 1993).

  Fully diluted earnings per share calculations assume the conversion of the
Company's convertible debentures when there is a dilutive effect on income
per share and when the ending market price of the Company's common stock
exceeds the average price during the year (shares used in such calculations
were 6,282,000 in 1991, 8,221,000 in 1992 and 6,971,000 in 1993).

Industry Segment Information
- ----------------------------
  The Company's single business segment, consulting, provides engineering and
architectural services to local and state governments, the Federal government
and the private sector.  The Company's services are primarily utilized for
planning, design and program and construction management of infrastructure
and environmental projects.

  The Company's revenues from local, state and Federal government agencies
and private businesses for the last three fiscal years are as follows:

                                     Years Ended October 31,

Reclassifications
- -----------------
  Reclassifications of certain balances for the years ended October 31, 1992
and 1991 have been made to conform to the October 31, 1993 financial
statement presentation and have not affected previously reported net income
or shareholders' equity.

NOTE 2.  QUASI-REORGANIZATION
 
  In conjunction with a restructuring completed in fiscal year 1990, the
Company, with the approval of its Board of Directors, implemented a quasi-
reorganization effective February 21, 1990 and revalued certain assets and
liabilities to fair value as of that date.

  The fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities at the date of the
quasi-reorganization were determined by management to approximate their
carrying value and no further adjustment of historical bases was required. 
No assets were written-up in conjunction with the revaluation.  As part of
the quasi-reorganization, the deficit in retained earnings of $92,523,000 was
eliminated against additional paid-in capital.  The balance in retained
earnings at October 31, 1993 represents the accumulated net earnings arising
subsequent to the date of the quasi-reorganization.

  Prior to October 10, 1989, the Company had available net operating loss
("NOL") carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately
$51,000,000.  As a result of a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") that occurred on October 10, 1989, the
Company's NOL carryforwards for financial statement and Federal income tax
purposes became limited to approximately $750,000 per year for the succeeding
fifteen-year carryforward period for an aggregate of $11,250,000, plus NOL
attributable to recognized built-in gains limited to $14,000,000 by IRC
Section 382, for a total of $25,250,000.  The financial statement tax
benefits arising from these NOL carryforwards will be recognized as a
reduction in financial statement tax expense and an addition to paid-in
capital in the years utilized.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had utilized
$8,000,000 of the total $25,250,000 for Federal income tax purposes and
$8,100,000 for financial statement purposes.

  Subsequent to October 10, 1989, the date of the change in ownership, the
Company incurred and has available additional NOL carryforwards of
approximately $3,000,000 for Federal income tax and financial statement
purposes.  Generally, these NOL carryforwards will offset future income
without limitation over the following fifteen-year period and will be
recognized as a reduction in financial statement tax expense in the year
utilized.

  While the Company has available NOL carryforwards for Federal income tax
purposes, for state tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily available
to offset income subject to tax.  Accordingly, state income taxes have been
provided.

Credit Agreement
- ----------------
  At October 1993, the Company's line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo
Bank (the "Bank") provides for advances up to $10,000,000 and expires
April 29, 1994.  The line of credit is collateralized by all the assets of
the Company, including the stock of its subsidiaries. Borrowings on the line
of credit bear interest at the Bank's prime rate plus one-half percent. At
October 31, 1993, the Company had $9,829,000 available to it under the line
of credit agreement.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding
letters of credit totalling $171,000 which reduced the amount available to
the Company under its Bank line of credit.

  Under the Bank line of credit agreement the Company is required to satisfy
certain financial and non-financial covenants.  The Company was in compliance
with all financial and non-financial covenants related to the line of credit
agreement at October 31, 1993 and October 31, 1992.

Related Parties
- ---------------
  At October 31, 1992, the Company had a $6,000,000 line of credit
represented by the January Notes, of which $4,000,000 is with Richard C.
Blum & Associates Incorporated, ("RCBA, Inc.") and $2,000,000 with Altus
Finance ("Altus").  RCBA, Inc., through various partnerships, beneficially
owns approximately 25% of the Company's common shares (approximately 37%
assuming exercise of additional warrants) outstanding at October 31, 1993. 
Richard C. Blum, a director of the Company, is also Chairman of RCBA, Inc.

  The January Notes were fully drawn at October 31, 1992 and are due
November 1, 2000.  In December 1992, the Company repurchased the $2,000,000
in January Notes held by Altus for $1,340,000 in cash.  On the date of the
transaction, the $2,000,000 in January Notes had a net book value of
$1,190,000.  The remaining $4,000,000 line of credit with RCBA, Inc. was
fully drawn at October 31, 1993, bears interest at 6 % per annum and is
subordinate only to the Bank line of credit.

Debentures
- ----------
  The Company's 6 % Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2012 are
convertible into the Company's common shares at the rate of $206.30 per
share.  Sinking fund payments are calculated to retire 70% of the debentures
prior to maturity beginning in February 1998.  Interest is payable semi-
annually in February and August.  Interest is payable semi-annually in
January and July on the Company's 8-5/8% Subordinated Debentures due 2004. 
Both the 6 % Convertible Subordinated Debentures and the 8-5/8% Senior
Subordinated Debentures are subordinate to all debt to RCBA, Inc. and the
Bank.

Obligations under Leases
- ------------------------
  Total rental expense included in operations for operating leases for the
fiscal years ended October 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 amounted to $4,938,000,
$5,306,000 and $4,994,000, respectively. Certain of the lease rentals are
subject to renewal options and escalation based upon property taxes and
operating expenses.  These operating lease agreements expire at varying dates
through 2002.

  In fiscal 1992, the Company terminated its lease at its Cleveland, Ohio
facility.  As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a net gain
of $743,000.

  Obligations under non-cancelable lease agreements are as follows:

NOTE 7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Currently, the Company has $21,000,000 "per occurrence" comprehensive
general liability insurance coverage with an aggregate limit of $22,000,000. 
The Company has also deposited $1,000,000 with an insurer to cover errors and
omissions ("E&O") and environmental impairment liability ("EIL") claims and
maintains with different insurers' policies for excess E&O coverage with an
aggregate limit of $14,000,000.  The first $1,000,000 policy of E&O and EIL
coverage is essentially self-insurance.  Also, the E&O and EIL coverage is on
a "claims made" basis, covering only claims actually made to the insurer
during the one-year policy period currently in effect.  Thus, if the Company
does not continue to maintain this policy, it will have no coverage under the
policy for claims made after its termination date even if the occurrence was
during the term of coverage.  It is the Company's intent to maintain this
type of coverage, but there can be no assurance that the Company can maintain
its existing coverage, that claims will not exceed the amount of insurance
coverage or that there will not be claims relating to prior periods that were
subject only to claims made coverage.

  Various legal proceedings are pending against the Company or its
subsidiaries alleging breaches of contract or negligence in connection with
the performance of professional services.  In some actions punitive or treble
damages are sought which substantially exceed the Company's insurance
coverage.  The Company's management does not believe that any of such
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position and operations of the Company.

NOTE 8.  CAPITAL STOCK

  Declaration of dividends, except Common Stock dividends, is restricted by
the Bank line of credit agreement.  Further, declaration of dividends may be
precluded by existing Delaware law.

  In fiscal 1991, the Company in a secondary public offering sold 2,875,000
shares of Common Stock at $7.50 per share.

  The 1987 Restricted Stock Plan provides for grants of up to 16,537 shares
of Common Stock to key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  An
employee selected to receive shares under the Plan will not be required to
pay any consideration for the shares.  Shares issued to an employee are
subject to forfeiture in the event that the employment of the employee
terminates for any reason other than death.  The forfeiture restrictions
lapse with respect to portions of the grant over a five-year period
subsequent to the grant date.  As of October 31, 1993, 6,872 restricted

  The 1979 Stock Option Plan (the "1979 Option Plan") provided for grants of
options to purchase shares of Common Stock to directors, officers and key
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries at prices and for periods (not
to exceed ten years) as determined by the Board of Directors.  The 1979
Option Plan also provided for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights and
incentive stock options.  The 1979 Option Plan expired in February 1989, and
no further options or rights may be granted under the Plan.

  On October 20, 1988, the stockholders approved a replacement option program
pursuant to which non-management members of the Board of Directors granted
replacement stock options to selected employees, exercisable at then current
market prices.  The selected employees then exchanged their outstanding
options for new options covering two shares for each three shares covered by
the options being replaced.  Options to purchase 16,561 shares were exchanged
for pre-existing options.

  On April 27, 1989, the stockholders approved the 1989 Stock Option and
Rights Plan (the "1989 Plan").  The 1989 Plan provides for the grant of
50,000 options to purchase shares of Common Stock to directors, officers and
key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries at prices and for periods
(not to exceed ten years) as determined by the Board of Directors.  The 1989
Option Plan also provides for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights.  No
options have been granted under this plan.

  On March 26, 1991, the stockholders approved the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan
(the "1991 Plan").  The 1991 Plan provides for the grant not to exceed
1,500,000 Restricted Shares, Stock Units and Options, plus the number of
shares of Common Stock remaining available for awards under the 1987
Restricted Stock Plan (9,655) and the 1989 Plan (50,000) to key employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries at prices and for periods as determined by
the Board of Directors.  The 1991 Plan prohibits granting new options under
the 1987 Restricted Stock Plan and the 1989 Plan.

  Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan") implemented in
September 1985, employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll
deductions of up to 10% of the employee's base pay.  Contributions are
credited to each participant's account on the last day of each six-month
participation period of the ESP Plan (which commences on January 1, and
July 1 of each year).  The purchase price for each share of Common Stock
shall be the lower of 85 percent of the fair market value of such share on
the last trading day before the participation period commences or 85 percent
of the fair market value of such share on the last trading day in the
participation period.  The ESP Plan was suspended effective September 19,
1988.  On March 24, 1992, the stockholders approved reinstating the ESP Plan. 
Employees purchased 26,246 shares under the ESP Plan in fiscal 1993 and
16,492 shares in fiscal 1992.

  On February 21, 1990, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,819,148
shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $4.34 per share and expires
February 14, 1997.

I.1 PURPOSE

The URS Corporation ("URS") 1993 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is
intended to provide incentive compensation to individuals who make an
important contribution to URS' financial performance.  Specific Plan
objectives are to:


    -    Focus key Employees on achieving specific financial targets;


    -    Reinforce a team orientation;


    -    Provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding
         performance; and


    -    Enhance the ability of URS Corporation to attract and retain highly
         talented and competent individuals.

II.1  GENERAL PLAN DESCRIPTION

The 1993 Incentive Compensation Plan provides the opportunity for key
Employees of URS Corporation (the "Company") to receive cash Awards based on
a combination of Company and individual performance.

An overview of how the Plan works is shown schematically on the facing page. 
In general, certain Employees will be selected to participate in the Plan at
the beginning of or during the Plan Year.  These individuals are referred to
in the Plan as "Designated Participants."  Upon selection to participate in
the Plan, each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award
Percentage.  This Target Award Percentage, multiplied by the Participant's
Base Salary earned during the Plan Year, will equal the Participant's Target
Award.  This Target Award represents the amount that is expected to be paid
to a Designated Participant if certain financial Performance Objectives for
URS have been fully met.

In addition, funds will be set aside for discretionary Awards to selected
other Employees (referred to in the Plan as "Nondesignated Participants"),
who have demonstrated outstanding individual performance during the Plan
Year.  It is expected that the amount available to Non-designated
Participants for the 1993 Plan Year will be $25,000, assuming that URS meets
its financial objectives.

The sum of all Target Awards for Designated Participants and expected payouts
to Non-designated Participants will equal the Target Bonus Pool.  The Actual
Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Pool upward or downward based on URS'
actual performance in relationship to its Performance Objectives.

Actual Awards to Designated Participants and actual funds available for
distribution to Non-designated Participants will vary from target amounts
based on the relationship between the Actual Bonus Pool and the Target Bonus
Pool.

A detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the following
sections of this document.


II.2  DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS

Plan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the opinion of
the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of URS, have the opportunity to
significantly impact the annual operating success of the Company.  These
Employees, referred to as "Designated Participants," will be notified in
writing of their selection to participate in the Plan.  This notification
letter, for all Participants except the CEO of URS, will be signed by the CEO





                                    II-1

                              Page 53 of 90                            <PAGE>

of URS.  The letter of participation for the CEO will be signed by the
chairman of the Compensation Committee.

In addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group of other
Employees who are selected to receive Awards based on their outstanding
individual performance during the Plan Year.  These other Employees, referred
to as "Nondesignated Participants," will not be selected until the completion
of the Plan Year.  The selection of Non-designated Participants will be
determined by the CEO of URS, subject to the approval of the Compensation
Committee.


II.3  TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS

Each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This
Target Award Percentage, when multiplied by the individual's Base Salary
earned during the Plan Year, represents the anticipated payout to a
Designated Participant if URS' Performance Objectives are met.

Each Designated Participant's Target Award Percentage will be included in the
letter of notification mentioned in Section II.2.


II.4  TARGET BONUS POOL

The Target Bonus Pool (Target Pool) will equal the sum of all Target Awards
for Designated Participants PLUS an amount set aside for distribution to
Non-designated Participants.  For 1993, the Target Bonus Pool equals
$442,000.


II.5  URS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

For 1993, URS' Performance Objectives are focused on the need to improve
profitability and generate cash.  The Performance Objectives and weightings
for the 1993 Plan Year are as follows:






                                    II-2

                              Page 54 of 90                            <PAGE>

            URS CORPORATION PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND WEIGHTINGS

    Performance Measure      Weighting            Performance Objective
    -------------------      ---------            ---------------------
    Net Income ($000s)          50%                      $5,600
    Return on Total 
      Capital (ROTC)            50%                        15%

For the purposes of the Plan, ROTC is defined as:

                   [(A+B)   ((C+D) 2)]

              where:

              A =  Net Income
              B =  After-Tax Interest
              C =  Interest-bearing debt plus equity at the beginning of the
                   Plan Year
              D =  Interest-bearing debt plus equity at the end of the Plan
                   Year

Net Income will be calculated AFTER all URS Corporation (corporate) AND URS
Consultants (URSC) bonuses are assumed to have been paid.

It is possible that in the course of the Plan Year, unforeseen events could
have a material effect upon URS Corporation's performance relative to the
Performance Measures.  Such events might include, but are not limited to,
acquisitions and public offerings.  The effect of such events will be treated
on a case by case basis.  In general, acquisitions and public offerings will
be treated as follows:

Acquisitions
- ------------
In the event that the Company completes an acquisition during the Plan Year,
the Performance Objectives will be adjusted for the projected financial
impact of the acquisition for the balance of the Year and potential Awards
under the Plan will be calculated accordingly.

Equity Transactions
- -------------------
In the event that URS issues or buys back Company stock during the Plan Year,
the financial impact of such a transaction will not be included in
calculating potential Awards under the Plan.

II.6  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL

The Actual Bonus Pool (Actual Pool) will vary from the Target Pool based on
the relationship between the actual performance of URS and the Performance
Objectives.  The Actual Pool will vary in relationship to the Target Pool
based on the following table:


                                    II-3

                              Page 55 of 90                            <PAGE>

                RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URS PERFORMANCE AND THE
            ACTUAL BONUS POOL AS A % OF THE TARGET BONUS POOL<F1>

     Net Income (weighted 50%)               ROTC (weighted 50%)   
     --------------------------          --------------------------
      Actual          Actual Pool         Actual         Actual Pool
    Performance        as a % of        Performance       as a % of
      ($000s)         Target Pool           (%)          Target Pool
    -----------       -----------       -----------      -----------
      $11,200           200%<F2>            30%            200%<F2>
        5,600           100%                15%            100%
     =< 4,200             0%             =< 12%              0%


[FN]
<F1>The calculation of the Actual Award as a % of Target will be interpolated
    for performance between discrete points.

<F2>Awards have no upper limit and will be extrapolated for performance
    beyond discrete points.



Based on the table above, the Actual Award will vary depending upon actual
performance in relation to Performance Objectives and the weighting of the
Performance Objectives.  The example on the opposite page illustrates the
application of the table and the interpolation and weighting calculations.


II.7  ACTUAL AWARDS TO DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS

Actual Awards to Designated Participants will vary from Target levels based
on the relationship between the Actual Bonus Pool and the Target Pool.

After allocating Actual Awards to Designated Participants, the remaining
funds in the Actual Pool will be available for allocation to Non-designated
Participants.

Actual Awards distributed to Non-designated Participants will be determined
on a discretionary basis by the CEO, subject to the approval of the
Compensation Committee.  The Company is under no obligation to distribute the
entire Actual Pool.  The sum of all Awards to Non-designated Participants may
not exceed the amount available in the Actual Pool.




                                    II-4

                              Page 56 of 90                            <PAGE>

                              Page 57 of 90                            <PAGE>

III.1  AWARD PAYMENT

Assessment of actual performance and payout of Awards will be subject to the
completion of the 1993 Year-end independent audit.

The Actual Award earned, up to the Target Award level, will be paid to the
Participant (or the Participant's heirs in the case of death) in cash within
30 days of the completion of the independent audit.  Any Actual Award earned
in excess of the Target Award will be automatically deferred until the end of
fiscal 1994.  This deferred portion of the Award will be paid to the
Participant within 30 days of the end of fiscal 1994, provided that the
Participant is still an Employee of URS or one of its Affiliates at Year-end
1994 except for death, permanent disability, or retirement.  A Participant
whose employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated prior to the
end of fiscal 1994 for any other reason forfeits the deferred portion of the
Award.

The Company is under no obligation to pay interest on the deferred portion of
the Award and will not do so.


III.2  EMPLOYMENT

In order to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must be employed
by URS or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year, except as otherwise noted
below.  A Participant must also have performed his/her duties satisfactorily
during the Year, as determined by the CEO of URS.  The Compensation Committee
will assess the performance of the CEO.


III.3  TERMINATION

If Termination of a Designated Participant's employment occurs during the
Plan Year by reason of death, permanent disability, or retirement, the
Designated Participant (or the Participant's heirs in the case of death) will
be eligible to receive a prorata Award based on the time employed as a
Participant and the Objectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who
have earned an Award on this basis will receive payment on the same schedule
as other Plan Participants, except that there will be no deferral of Awards
in excess of Target.  In the event that a Participant terminates for reasons
above during Fiscal Year 1993, any deferred Award will be paid within 30 days
of Termination.

A Participant whose employment with the Company or its Affiliates is
terminated prior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason (whether
voluntarily or involuntarily) will forfeit the opportunity to earn an Award
under the Plan.

                              Page 58 of 90                            <PAGE>

III.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS

Individuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan participation and
who have a minimum of three months as a Designated Participant will be
eligible to receive a pro-rata Award based on the time employed as a
Participant and the Objectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the
Participant is employed by URS or an Affiliate at Year-end.


III.5  PLAN FUNDING

Estimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and charged as an
expense against the income statement of URS.  At the end of each fiscal
quarter, the estimated Actual Awards under the Plan will be evaluated based
on actual performance to date.  The monthly accrual rate will then be
adjusted so that the cost of the Plan is fully accrued at Year-end.

Accrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards to
Participants.


III.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION

Responsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding Plan
administration are divided among the URS CEO and the Compensation Committee
of the URS Board of Directors.  The exhibit on the facing page outlines the
levels of responsibility and authority assigned to each.

Notwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority regarding
all aspects of Plan administration, and the resolution of any disputes.  The
Committee may, without notice, amend, suspend or revoke the Plan.


III.7  ASSIGNMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

No employee has a claim or right to be a Participant in the Plan, to continue
as a Participant, or to be granted an Award under the Plan.  URS is not
obligated to give uniform treatment (e.g., Target Award Percentages,
discretionary Awards, etc.) to Employees or Participants under the Plan. 
Participation in the Plan does not give an Employee the right to be retained
in the employment of URS, nor does it imply or confer any other employment
rights.

Nothing contained in the Plan will be construed to create a contract of
employment with any Participant.  URS reserves the right to elect any person
to its offices and to remove Employees in any manner and upon any basis
permitted by law.

                                    III-2

                              Page 59 of 90                            <PAGE>

Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed to require URS to deposit,
invest or set aside amounts for the payment of any Awards.  Participation in
the Plan does not give a Participant any ownership, security, or other rights
in any assets of URS or any of its Affiliates.


III.8  WITHHOLDING TAX

URS will deduct from all Awards paid under the Plan any taxes required by law
to be withheld.


III.9  EFFECTIVE DATE

The Plan is effective as of November 1, 1992, and will remain in effect for
the Fiscal Year ending October 31, 1993 unless otherwise terminated or
extended by the Committee.


III.10  VALIDITY

In the event any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or
unenforceable, the same will not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the
validity of any other provision of the Plan.


III.11  APPLICABLE LAW

The Plan will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California.

the Actual Bonus Pool versus the Target Pool.

II.1  GENERAL PLAN DESCRIPTION (see facing exhibit)

The 1993 Incentive Compensation Plan provides the opportunity for key Employees
of URS Consultants Inc. ("the Company") to receive cash Awards based on a
combination of Company and individual performance.

An overview of how the Plan works is shown schematically on the facing page. 
In general, a Target Bonus Pool is established.  This amount represents the
total Awards that are expected to be paid to selected URS Consultants Employees
if certain financial Performance Objectives for URS Consultants have been fully
met.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool upward or
downward based on URS Consultants' actual performance in relationship to its
Performance Objectives.  This adjusted bonus pool is the Actual Bonus Pool,
from which Actual Award payouts will be made.

At the beginning of or during the Plan Year, certain Employees will be selected
to participate in the Plan.  These individuals are referred to in the Plan as
"Designated Participants."  Upon selection to participate in the Plan, each
Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This Target
Award Percentage, multiplied by the Participant's Base Salary earned during the
Plan Year, will equal the Participant's Target Award.  This Target Award will
be earned for meeting both pre-determined URS Consultants and individual
Performance Objectives.  Individual Performance Objectives will vary based on
the Participant's role within the organization.  Each Designated Participant's
Actual Award could vary from the Target Award, based on the individual's actual
performance measured against his/her Performance Objectives, subject to the
amount available for distribution from the Actual Bonus Pool.

Another key feature of the Plan is that a portion of the Actual Bonus Pool will
be set aside for discretionary Awards to selected other Employees (referred to
in the Plan as "NonDesignated Participants"), who have demonstrated outstanding
individual performance during the Plan Year.

A detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the following
sections of this document.


II.2  DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS

Plan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the opinion of the
President of URS Consultants and the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of URS
Corporation (the "Parent Company"), have the opportunity to significantly
impact the annual operating success of URS Consultants.  These Employees,
referred to as "Designated Participants," will be notified in writing of their
selection to participate in the Plan.  This notification letter will be signed
by both the President of URS Consultants and the CEO of the Parent Company.

                                     II-1

                              Page 71 of 90                            <PAGE>

In addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group of other
Employees who are selected to receive Awards based on their outstanding
individual performance during the Plan Year.  These other Employees, referred
to as "Nondesignated Participants," will not be selected until the completion
of the Plan Year.  The selection of Non-designated Participants will be
determined by the President of URS Consultants, subject to the approval of the
CEO of the Parent Company.


II.3  TARGET BONUS POOL

A Target Bonus Pool is established, representing an amount which is expected to
be sufficient to pay each Designated Participant 100% of his/her Target Award,
with a remaining amount available for distribution to Non-designated
Participants. (The Awards to Non-designated Participants are estimated at
approximately 25% of the total Non-Designated Participants' Bonus Pool.)

This Target Bonus Pool is determined based on the current group of Designated
Participants and the anticipated group of Nondesignated Participants.  The
Target Pool is subject to change if the group of Designated Participants, the
group of NonDesignated Participants, or the Base Salaries of Designated
Participants change.

Subject to these potential changes, the Target Bonus Pool for the 1993 Plan
Year is established at $1,380,244.


II.4  URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

URS Consultants Performance Objectives are focused on the need to achieve
strong operating results (i.e., contribution) and generate cash through the
management of DSOs throughout the Year.  Performance will be evaluated based on
a combination of URS Consultants Contribution, Average Receivables Days Sales
Outstanding (DSO), New Sales and Other Growth measures.

The URS Consultants Performance objectives for the 1993 Plan Year are as
follows:









                                     II-2

                              Page 72 of 90                            <PAGE>

                    URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

    Performance Measures          Performance Objectives
    --------------------          ----------------------
    Contribution ($000s)                 $12,600
    Average DSO (Days)                      92
    New Sales ($000s)                    $161,000
    Other Growth ($000s)          Varies by Participant

URS Consultants Contribution is defined as total 1993 Fiscal Year URS
Consultants revenues less:

    -    Direct cost of sales;
    -    Indirect expenses; and
    -    ACCRUAL OF EXPECTED AWARDS FOR BOTH DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED
         PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE PLAN (I.E., THE PLAN MUST PAY FOR ITSELF)

The subtraction of expected Awards from revenues in calculating contribution
under the Plan means that the Contribution Objective, for purposes of the Plan,
is calculated after all bonuses have been accrued, or assumed to have been
paid.

URS Consultants Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is defined by the following
formula:

         BAR + UAR - BEC
         ---------------   x 90
             REVENUES

where BAR is billed accounts receivable, UAR is unbilled accounts receivable,
BEC is billings in excess of cost, and REVENUES is the sum of the last three
months revenues.  DSOs will be calculated monthly, and the average of the
twelve months DSOs will equal Average DSOs.

URS Consultants New Sales is defined as gross additions to backlog.

URS Consultants Other Growth is defined as growth in New Sales, designations,
indefinite delivery contracts, inter-office cooperation, and/or other measures
as defined in the Participant's notification letter.


II.5  WEIGHTING OF URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

The Target Bonus Pool will be weighted based on the aggregate weightings of the
individual Participants' Performance Objectives in the Plan.  Contribution will
be the most heavily weighted component followed by DSO performance, New Sales,
and Other Growth Measures.  An example of the weighting calculation is shown on
the facing page.

                                     II-3

                              Page 73 of 90                            <PAGE>

II.6  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL

The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool based on the
relationship between the actual performance of URs Consultants and the
Performance Objectives.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary in relationship to the
Target Bonus Pool based on the following table:

             RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE AND
           THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL AS A % OF THE TARGET BONUS POOL<F1>

[FN]
<F1>Awards for the Other Growth performance measure will be made at the
    discretion of the President of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer
    of the Parent Company.

<F2>Maximum upside opportunity of 200% of the Target Bonus Pool may be raised
    at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.  The calculation of the
    Actual Bonus Pool As A % Of Target will be interpolated for performance
    between discrete points shown in the table above.

Based on the table above, the Actual Bonus Pool could vary between 0% and 200%
of the Target Bonus Pool, depending upon actual performance in relation to

                                    II-4
                              Page 74 of 90                            <PAGE>

Performance Objectives and the weighting of the Performance Objectives.  The
example on the opposite page illustrates the application of the table and the
interpolation and weighting calculations.

Accrual of any Actual Pool tied to DSO, New Sales, and Other Growth performance
is contingent upon Contribution performance being at or above 85% of the
Performance Objective.


II.7  DISCRETIONARY BONUS POOL

It is the intent of the Plan that if the Actual Bonus Pool, as calculated in
Section II.6, should fall below 25% of the Target Bonus Pool, then a
Discretionary Bonus Pool will be created instead.

Awards from the Discretionary Pool may be made to selected Employees (both
Designated and Non-designated Participants) on a totally discretionary basis by
the President of URS Consultants, subject to the approval of the CEO of the
Parent Company.  The formation of the Discretionary Pool will not guarantee any
Award payments.  Rather, the Discretionary Pool will be used to recognize
selected outstanding Employees in the event that URS Consultants does not meet
or exceed 85% of its Contribution Performance Objective.  The total sum of
Awards made from the Discretionary Pool may not exceed 25% of the Target Bonus
Pool.


II.8  ACTUAL BONUS POOL ALLOCATION

Awards will be paid from the funds available in the Actual Bonus Pool.  The
portion of the pool actually allocated to NonDesignated Participants will be
determined after the end of the Plan Year at the discretion of the CEO of the
Parent Company, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, and may
vary from the estimated 20% of the total Actual Bonus Pool.  The sum of the
Actual Awards paid, including Awards made to Non-designated Participants, may
not exceed the available Actual Bonus Pool.


II.9  TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES

Each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This
Target Award Percentage, when multiplied by the individual's Base Salary earned
during the Plan Year, represents the anticipated payout to a Designated
Participant if all URS Consultants and the individual's Performance Objectives
are met.



                                     II-5

                              Page 75 of 90                            <PAGE>

Each Designated Participant's Target Award Percentage and individual
Performance Objectives will be included in the letter of notification mentioned
in Section II.2.


II.10  ACTUAL AWARDS FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS

Individual Performance Objectives will be assigned based on the economic unit
(i.e., URS Consultants, a region of URS Consultants, or an office of URS
Consultants) on which the Participant's performance has the greatest financial
impact.  Each Designated Participant will be notified of his/her economic unit,
the individual Performance Objectives associated with that unit, the weighting
of those Performance Objectives, and the relationship between individual unit
performance and Award levels in the letter of notification mentioned in
Section II.2.


II.11  ADJUSTMENT TO ACTUAL AWARDS

It is possible that the sum of the Actual Awards for Designated Participants
could exceed the Actual Bonus Pool available for Designated Participants.  This
result could happen for either one of two reasons.  First, the CEO of URS
Corporation could allocate more for Awards to Non-designated Participants than
was accrued.  Second, larger economic units could perform worse relative to the
smaller economic units, creating an insufficient Actual Bonus Pool.  In these
cases, all Actual Awards will be reduced pro-rata by a factor determined by
dividing the Actual Bonus Pool for Designated Participants by the sum of the
individual Actual Awards for Designated Participants.  An example of this
calculation is shown on the opposite page.

If the sum of Actual Awards is less than the Actual Bonus  Pool available for
Designated Participants, there will be no upward pro-ration of Awards paid.

III.1  AWARD PAYMENT

Assessment of actual performance and payout of Awards will be subject to the
completion of the 1993 Year-end independent audit.

The Actual Award earned, up to the Target Award level, will be paid to the
Participant (or the Participant's heirs in the case of death) in cash within
30 days of the completion of the independent audit.  Any Actual Award earned in
excess of the Target Award will be automatically deferred until the end of
fiscal 1994.  This deferred portion of the Award will be paid to the
Participant within 30 days of the end of fiscal 1994, provided that the
Participant is still an Employee of URS Consultants or one of its Affiliates at
Year-end 1994, except for death, permanent disability, or retirement.  A
Participant whose employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated
prior to the end of fiscal 1994 for any other reason forfeits the deferred
portion of the Award.

The Company is under no obligation to pay interest on the deferred portion of
the Award and will not do so.


III.2  EMPLOYMENT

In order to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must be employed by
URS Consultants or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year, except as
otherwise noted below.  A Participant must also have performed his/her duties
satisfactorily during the Year, as determined by the URS Consultants President. 
The Parent Company CEO will assess the performance of the President and
Executive Vice President.


III.3  TERMINATION

If Termination of a Designated Participant's employment occurs during the Plan
Year by reason of death, permanent disability, or retirement, the Designated
Participant (or the Participant's heirs in the case of death) will be eligible
to receive a prorata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
Objectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who have earned an Award
on this basis will receive payment on the same schedule as other Plan
Participants, except that there will be no deferral of Awards in excess of
Target.  In the event that a Participant terminates for reasons above during
Fiscal Year 1993, any deferred Award will be paid within 30 days of
Termination.

A Participant whose employment with the Company or its Affiliates is terminated
prior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily) will forfeit the opportunity to earn an Award under the Plan.

III.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS

Individuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan participation and
who have a minimum of three months as a Designated Participant will be eligible
to receive a pro-rata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
Objectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the Participant is
employed by URS Consultants or an Affiliate at Year-end.


III.5  PLAN FUNDING

Estimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and charged as an
expense against the income statement of URS Consultants and its economic units. 
At the end of each fiscal quarter, the estimated Actual Bonus Pool under the
Plan will be evaluated based on actual performance to date.  The monthly
accrual rate will then be adjusted so that the cost of the Plan is fully
accrued at Year-end.

Accrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards to
Participants.


III.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION

Responsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding Plan
administration are divided among the URS Consultants President, the URS
Corporation CEO, and the Compensation Committee of the URS Corporation Board of
Directors.  The exhibit on the facing page outlines the levels of
responsibility and authority assigned to each.

Notwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority regarding all
aspects of Plan administration, and the resolution of any disputes.  The
Committee may, without notice, amend, suspend or revoke the Plan.


III.7  ASSIGNMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

No employee has a claim or right to be a Participant in the Plan, to continue
as a Participant, or to be granted an Award under the Plan.  URS Consultants is
not obligated to give uniform treatment (e.g., Target Award Percentages,
discretionary Awards, etc.) to Employees or Participants under the Plan. 
Participation in the Plan does not give an Employee the right to be retained in
the employment of URS Consultants, nor does it imply or confer any other
employment rights.

Nothing contained in the Plan will be construed to create a contract of
employment with any Participant.  URS Consultants reserves the right to elect
any person to its offices and to remove Employees in any manner and upon any
basis permitted by law.

Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed to require URS Consultants to
deposit, invest or set aside amounts for the payment of any Awards. 
Participation in the Plan does not give a Participant any ownership, security,
or other rights in any assets of URS Consultants or any of its Affiliates.


III.8  WITHHOLDING TAX

URS Consultants will deduct from all Awards paid under the Plan any taxes
required by law to be withheld.


III.9  EFFECTIVE DATE

The Plan is effective as of November 1, 1992, and shall remain in effect for
the Fiscal Year ending October 31, 1993 unless otherwise terminated or extended
by the Committee.


III.10  VALIDITY

In the event any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable,
the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other
provision of the Plan.


III.11  APPLICABLE LAW

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California.

                                           Other Growth portion is therefore 0%

TARGET BONUS POOL ($000s)       $1,380     Since the pool generated is less
ACTUAL BONUS POOL ($000s)         $0       than 25% of the Target Pool, a

                                           of Target ($345) is generated


Actual awards to Designated Participants and funds available for distribution
to Non-designated Participants will vary from Target levels in relationship to
the Actual Bonus Pool versus the Target Pool.
