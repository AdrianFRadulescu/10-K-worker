                                     PART I

       ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
                 --------
            URS Corporation (the "Company") offers a broad range of
       planning, design and program and construction management services
       for engineering, architectural and environmental projects.  The
       Company serves public and private sector clients throughout the
       United States in two principal markets: infrastructure projects
       involving transportation systems, institutional and commercial
       facilities and water resources and environmental projects
       involving hazardous waste management and pollution control.

            The Company conducts its business through 24 offices located
       throughout the United States.  The Company has approximately
       1,300 full-time employees, many of whom hold advanced or
       technical degrees and have extensive experience in sophisticated
       disciplines applicable to the Company's business.  The Company
       believes that its geographic and technical diversity allow it to
       compete for local, regional and national projects, and enable it
       to apply to each project a variety of resources from its national
       network.

       Acquisitions
       ------------
            In January 1995, the Company acquired privately-held E.C.
       Driver & Associates, Inc. ("ECD") of Tallahassee, Florida.  ECD
       is a leading Florida-based transportation engineering firm
       specializing in bridge and highway design, including particular
       expertise in moveable bridges.  The 50-person firm has annualized
       revenues of approximately $5.0 million.

            On December 3, 1995, the Company and Greiner Engineering,
       Inc. ("Greiner") executed a letter of intent for the Company to
       acquire all the outstanding stock of Greiner pursuant to a merger
       of Greiner with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
       Greiner is a professional services firm operating in the
       engineering and architectural design services industry and
       headquartered in Irving, Texas.  The acquisition price will
       consist of $13.50 in cash plus 0.298 shares of the Company's
       Common Stock for each of the 4,698,442 outstanding shares of
       Greiner common stock, for an aggregate price of $63,429,000 and
       1.4 million shares of the Company's Common Stock.  Completion of
       this transaction is subject to due diligence, mutual approval of
       a formal purchase agreement and stockholder, regulatory and other
       approvals.  The transaction is expected to close by April 1996.

                                    Services
                                    --------
            The Company provides professional services in three major
       areas:  planning, design and program and construction management
       through the Company's 24 offices.  Each of these offices is
       responsible for obtaining local or regional contracts.  This
       approach allows regional government agencies and private clients

                                      -1-



                          Page 3 of 106                  <PAGE>

       to view the Company's offices as local businesses with superior
       service delivery capabilities.  Because the Company can draw from
       its large and diverse network of professional and technical
       resources, the Company has the capability to market and perform
       large multi-state projects.

       Planning
       --------
            Planning covers a broad range of assignments ranging from
       conceptual design and technical and economic feasibility studies
       to community involvement programs.  Planning services also
       involve developing alternative concepts for project
       implementation and analyzing the impacts of each alternative.

            In addition to traditional engineering and architectural
       planning services, the Company has extensive expertise in a
       number of highly specialized areas, including toll facilities,
       health care facility renovation, environmental site analysis,
       water quality planning for urban storm water management and site
       remediation assignments.

       Design
       ------
            The Company's professionals provide a broad range of design
       and design-related services, including computerized mapping,
       architectural and interior design, civil, sanitary and
       geotechnical engineering, process design and seismic (earthquake)
       analysis and design.  For each project, the Company identifies
       the project requirements and then integrates and coordinates the
       various design elements.  The result is a set of contract
       documents that may include plans, specifications and cost
       estimates that are used to build a project.  These documents
       detail design characteristics and set forth for the contractor
       the materials which should be used and the schedule for
       construction.  Other critical tasks in the design process may
       include value analysis and the assessment of construction and
       maintenance requirements.

       Program and Construction Management
       -----------------------------------
            The Company's program and construction management services
       include master scheduling of both the design and construction
       phases, construction and life-cycle cost estimating, cash flow
       analysis, value engineering, constructability reviews and bid
       management.  Once construction has begun, the Company supervises
       and coordinates the activities of the construction contractor. 
       This frequently involves acting as the owner's representative for
       on-site supervision and inspection of the contractor's work.  In
       this role, the Company's objective is to monitor a project's
       schedule, cost and quality.  The Company generally does not take
       contractual responsibility for the contractor's risks and
       methods, nor for site safety conditions.

                                    Markets
                                    -------
            The Company's strategy is to focus on two major markets: 
       infrastructure projects involving transportation systems,
       institutional and commercial facilities and water resources and
       environmental projects involving hazardous waste management and
       pollution control.  The Company has developed a nationwide
       identity based on its successful completion of a number of highly
       visible rehabilitation and expansion projects in these markets. 
       Although the Company views these markets as being distinct, the
       Company provides its planning, design and program and
       construction management services to both markets.

       Infrastructure
       --------------
            The Company has significant expertise in three areas
       relating to the infrastructure market: transportation systems,
       institutional and commercial facilities and water resources
       projects.

            TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  The Company's engineers, designers,
       planners and managers provide services for projects involving all
       types of transportation networks, such as highways, roadways,
       streets, bridges, rapid and mass transit systems, airports and
       marine facilities.  These services range from the design of
       interstate highways to harbor traffic simulation studies and may
       extend from conceptual planning through preliminary and final
       design to construction management.  Historically, the Company's
       emphasis in this market area has been on the design of new
       transportation facilities, but in recent years the rehabilitation
       of existing facilities has become a major focus.

            INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES.  The Company
       provides architectural, engineering design, space planning and
       construction supervision services to this market area.  Demand
       for low-maintenance, energy efficient facilities drives today's
       market for commercial and industrial buildings.  In addition,
       there is increased pressure to renovate facilities to meet
       changing needs and current building standards.

            WATER RESOURCES.  The Company's capabilities in this market
       area include the planning, design and program and construction
       management of water supply, storage, distribution and treatment
       systems, as well as work in basin plans, groundwater supply,
       customer rate studies, urban run-off, bond issues, flood control,
       water quality analysis and beach erosion control.

       Environmental
       -------------
            The Company has developed expertise in two principal
       environmental markets:  hazardous waste management and pollution
       control.



                                      -3-



                          Page 5 of 106                  <PAGE>

            HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT.  The Company conducts initial
       site investigations, designs remedial actions for site clean-up
       and provides construction management services during site
       clean-up.  This market involves identifying and developing
       measures to effectively dispose of hazardous and toxic waste at
       contaminated sites.  The Company also provides air quality
       monitoring and designs individual facility modifications required
       to meet local, state and Federal air quality standards.  This
       work requires specialized knowledge of and compliance with
       complex Federal and state regulations, as well as the permitting
       and approval processes.  Solid waste management services provided
       by the Company include facility siting, transfer station design
       and community-wide master planning.

            The Company has been awarded several significant contracts
       with government agencies, including a contract with the U.S.
       Department of Defense for environmental engineering and
       remediation work in the Northwest and Alaska under the
       Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action-Navy ("Navy CLEAN")
       program and two contracts with the U.S. Environmental Protection
       Agency ("EPA") under its Alternative Remedial Contracting
       Strategy ("EPA ARCS") program.  Under the Navy CLEAN contract,
       the Company provides site inspections, site characterizations,
       remediation designs and action plans for contaminated Navy
       facilities.  A portion of the Navy CLEAN contract, which is
       expected to have a ten-year term, is awarded each year over the
       life of the contract.  In fiscal 1995 and 1994, the Company
       generated revenues associated with the Navy CLEAN contract of
       $16.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively.  The Company's
       services under the ten-year EPA ARCS contracts include
       investigating the nature and extent of contamination by hazardous
       materials, performing risk assessments, evaluating the
       feasibility of various options for remedial action and providing
       management, technical, quality assurance and health and safety
       reviews of potentially responsible party submittals.  Work under
       the EPA ARCS contracts is performed on a task order basis.  In
       fiscal 1995 and 1994, the Company recognized revenues of
       $20.5 million and $26.7 million, respectively, under the EPA ARCS
       contracts.

            POLLUTION CONTROL.  The Company's principal services in this
       market include the planning and design of new wastewater
       facilities, such as sewer systems and wastewater treatment
       plants, and the analysis and expansion of existing systems.  The
       types of work performed by the Company include infiltration/
       inflow studies, combined sewer overflow studies, water quality
       facilities planning projects and design and construction
       management services for wastewater treatment plants.

       Contract Pricing and Terms of Engagement
       ----------------------------------------
            Under its cost-plus contracts, the Company charges clients
       negotiated rates based on the Company's direct and indirect
       costs.  Labor costs and subcontractor services are the principal
       components of the Company's direct costs.  Federal Acquisition
       Regulations limit the recovery of certain specified indirect
       costs on contracts subject to such regulations.  In negotiating a
       cost-plus contract, the Company estimates all recoverable direct
       and indirect costs and then adds a profit component, which is
       either a percentage of total recoverable costs or a fixed
       negotiated fee, to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the
       project.  The Company receives payment based on the total actual
       number of labor hours expended.  If the actual total number of
       labor hours is lower than estimated, the revenues from that
       project will be lower than estimated.  If the actual labor hours
       expended exceed the initial negotiated amount, the Company must
       obtain a contract modification in order to receive payment for
       such overage.  The Company's profit margin will increase to the
       extent the Company is able to reduce actual costs below the
       estimates used to produce the negotiated fixed prices on
       contracts not covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations;
       conversely, the Company's profit margin will decrease and the
       Company may realize a loss on the project if the Company does not
       control costs and exceeds the overall estimates used to produce
       the negotiated price.

            Cost-plus contracts covered by Federal Acquisition
       Regulations require an audit of actual costs and provide for
       upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ
       from billed recoverable costs.  The Defense Contract Audit
       Agency, auditors for the Department of Defense and other Federal
       agencies, has completed incurred cost audits of the Company's
       Federal contracts for fiscal years ended through October 31,
       1988, resulting in immaterial adjustments.

            Under its fixed-price contracts, the Company receives an
       agreed sum negotiated in advance for the specified scope of work. 
       Under fixed-price contracts, no payment adjustments are made if
       the Company over-estimates or under-estimates the number of labor
       hours required to complete the project, unless there is a change
       of scope in the work to be performed.  Accordingly, the Company's
       profit margin will increase to the extent the number of labor
       hours and other costs are below the contracted amounts.  The
       profit margin will decrease and the Company may realize a loss on
       the project if the number of labor hours required and other costs
       exceed the estimates.

       Backlog, Project Designations and Indefinite Delivery Contracts
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
            The Company's contract backlog was $196.4 million at
       October 31, 1995, compared to $159.1 million at October 31, 1994. 
       The Company's contract backlog consists of the amount billable at
       a particular point in time for future services under executed

                                      -6-

       funded contracts.  Indefinite delivery contracts, which are
       executed contracts requiring the issuance of task orders, are
       included in contract backlog only to the extent the task orders
       are actually issued and funded.  Of the contract backlog of
       $196.4 million at October 31, 1995, approximately 30%, or
       $59.0 million, is not reasonably expected to be filled within the
       next fiscal year ending October 31, 1996.

            The Company has also been designated by customers as the
       recipient of certain future contracts.  These "designations" are
       projects that have been awarded to the Company but for which
       contracts have not yet been executed. Task orders under executed
       indefinite delivery contracts which are expected to be issued in
       the immediate future are included in designations.  Total
       contract designations were estimated to be $194.1 million at
       October 31, 1995, as compared to $172.0 million at October 31,
       1994.  Typically, a significant portion of designations are
       converted into signed contracts.  However, there is no assurance
       this will continue to occur in the future.

            Indefinite delivery contracts are signed contracts pursuant
       to which work is performed only when specific task orders are
       issued by the client.  Generally these contracts exceed one year
       and often indicate a maximum term and potential value.  Examples
       of such contracts are the Navy CLEAN and EPA ARCS contracts. 
       Certain indefinite delivery contracts are for a definite time
       period with renewal option periods at the client's discretion. 
       While the Company believes that it will continue to get work
       under these contracts over their entire term, because of renewals
       and the necessity for issuance of individual task orders,
       continued work by the Company and the realization of their
       potential maximum values under these contracts is not assured.

            However, because of the increasing frequency with which the
       Company's government and private sector clients use this
       contracting method, the Company believes their potential value
       should be disclosed along with backlog and designations as an
       indicator of the Company's future business.  When the client
       notifies the Company of the scope and pricing of task orders, the
       estimated value of such task orders is added to designations. 
       When such task orders are signed and funded, their value goes
       into backlog.  At October 31, 1995, the potential value of the
       Company's five largest indefinite delivery contracts was as
       follows:

                                  Competition
                                  -----------
            The engineering and architectural services industry is
       highly fragmented and very competitive.  As a result, in each
       specific market area the Company competes with many engineering
       and consulting firms, several of which are substantially larger
       than the Company and which possess greater financial resources. 
       No firm currently dominates any significant portion of the
       Company's market areas.

            Competition is based on quality of service, expertise,
       price, reputation and local presence.  The Company believes that
       it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors in
       the market areas it serves.

                                   Employees

            The Company has approximately 1,300 full-time employees,
       many of whom hold advanced or technical degrees and have
       extensive experience in a variety of disciplines applicable to
       the Company's business.  The Company also employs, at various
       times on a temporary basis, up to several hundred additional
       persons to meet contractual requirements.  Twenty-seven of the
       Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining
       agreement.  The Company has never experienced a strike or work
       stoppage.  The Company believes that employee relations are good.

       ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
                 ----------
            The Company leases office space in 24 principal locations
       throughout the United States.  Most of the leases are written for
       a minimum term of three years with options for renewal, sublease
       rights and allowances for improvements.  Significant lease
       agreements expire at various dates through the year 2005.  The
       Company believes that its current facilities are sufficient for
       the operation of its business and that suitable additional space
       in various local markets is available to accommodate any needs
       that may arise.

       security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
       ended October 31, 1995.

                             Results of Operations
                             ---------------------
       Fiscal 1995 Compared with Fiscal 1994
       -------------------------------------
            Revenues in fiscal 1995 were $179.8 million, or 10% over the
       amount reported in fiscal 1994.  The growth in revenues is
       primarily attributable to increases in revenues derived from all
       areas of the Company's business, particularly transportation and
       other infrastructure projects in the Northeast.  Revenues
       generated from the Company's three largest contracts; Navy CLEAN,
       EPA ARCS 9&10 and EPA ARCS 6,7,&8, decreased in fiscal 1995 to
       $37.1 million as compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 1994.  The
       decrease in revenues from these contracts is primarily due to a
       decrease in the number of task orders for hazardous waste
       services on all of the above EPA ARCS contracts.  Revenues
       generated from private commercial businesses increased from $16.3
       million in fiscal 1994 to $21.1 million in fiscal 1995.

            Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and
       direct expenses including subcontractor costs, increased
       $6.3 million, or 6%, over the amount reported in fiscal 1994. 
       The increase is due to an overall increase in the Company's
       business in fiscal 1995 as compared to fiscal 1994.  Indirect
       general and administrative expenses ("IG&A") increased to
       $63.2 million in fiscal 1995 from $55.5 million in fiscal 1994.
       Expressed as a percentage of revenues, IG&A expenses increased
       from 34% in fiscal 1994 to 35% in fiscal 1995.  The Company
       attributes this increase to the overall increase in the Company's
       business.  Net interest expense remained relatively constant at
       $1.4 million in fiscal 1995.

            The Company earned $6.4 million before income taxes in
       fiscal 1995 compared to $4.9 million in fiscal 1994.  While the
       Company has available net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards
       which partially off-set otherwise taxable income for Federal
       income tax purposes, for state income tax purposes such amounts
       are not necessarily available to offset income subject to tax. 
       Accordingly, the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1995 was

                                      -15-



                          Page 17 of 106                  <PAGE>

       approximately 20%.  This effective income tax rate is based on
       the Company using a significant portion of the unlimited NOL
       available to it in fiscal year 1995.  See Income Taxes below and
       Note 6 - Income Taxes - to the Company's Consolidated Financial
       Statements.

            Net income increased to $5.1 million in fiscal 1995 as
       compared to $4.4 million in fiscal 1994.  The Company earned
       $0.67 per share on a fully-diluted basis in fiscal 1995 compared
       to $0.60 per share in fiscal 1994.

            The Company's backlog of signed and funded contracts at
       October 31, 1995 was $196.4 million as compared to $159.1 million
       at October 31, 1994.  The value of the Company's designations was
       $194.1 million at October 31, 1995, as compared to $172.0 million
       at October 31, 1994.

       Fiscal 1994 Compared with Fiscal 1993
       -------------------------------------
            Revenues in fiscal 1994 grew to $164.1 million, or 13%, over
       the amount reported in fiscal 1993.  The growth in revenues was
       primarily attributable to increases in revenues generated from
       all areas of the Company's business, particularly transportation
       and other infrastructure projects in the Northeast.  Revenues
       derived from the Company's three largest contracts: Navy CLEAN,
       EPA ARCS 9&10 and EPA ARCS 6,7&8, were $41.0 million in fiscal
       1994 compared to $38.5 million in fiscal 1993.  The increase in
       revenues from these contracts was due to an increase in the
       number of task orders for hazardous waste clean-up services. 
       Revenues generated from private commercial businesses decreased
       to $16.3 million in fiscal 1994 from $16.7 million in fiscal
       1993. 

            Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and
       direct expenses including subcontractor costs, increased
       $11.0 million, or 12%, over the amount reported in fiscal 1993. 
       The increase was due to an overall increase in the Company's
       business in fiscal 1994 as compared to fiscal 1993.  In fiscal
       1994, IG&A expenses increased to $55.5 million from $51.6 million
       in fiscal 1993.  However, expressed as a percentage of revenues,
       IG&A expenses decreased from 35% in fiscal 1993 to 34% in fiscal
       1994.  The Company attributes this decrease to continued emphasis
       on cost controls, as well as the one-time charge of $2.0 million
       taken in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 in connection with the
       planned phase-out of certain of the Company's architectural
       offices and for claims on certain of the Company's architectural
       projects.  Net interest expense remained constant at $1.2 million
       in fiscal 1994 due to significantly lower debt levels in fiscal
       1993 and 1994 as the result of the secondary common stock
       offering completed by the Company in June 1991.

            The Company earned $4.9 million before income taxes in
       fiscal 1994 compared to $1.4 million in fiscal 1993.  While the
       Company had available NOL carryforwards which partially off-set

                                      -16-



                          Page 18 of 106                  <PAGE>

       otherwise taxable income for Federal income tax purposes, for
       state income tax purposes such amounts were not necessarily
       available to offset income subject to tax.  Accordingly, the
       Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1994 was approximately
       9%.

            Net income increased 238% to $4.4 million compared to
       $1.3 million in fiscal 1993.  The Company earned $0.60 per share
       in fiscal 1994 compared to $0.18 per share in fiscal 1993.

            The Company's backlog of signed and funded contracts at
       October 31, 1994 was $159.1 million as compared to $142.0 million
       at October 31, 1993.  The value of the Company's designations,
       which are awarded projects for which contracts have not been
       signed, was $172.0 million at October 31, 1994 as compared to
       $213.6 million at October 31, 1993.

       Income Taxes
       ------------
            Prior to October 10, 1989, the Company had available NOL
       carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately
       $51.0 million.  As a result of a change in ownership as defined
       by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
       ("IRC") that occurred on October 10, 1989, the Company's NOL
       carryforwards for financial statement and Federal income tax
       purposes became limited to approximately $750,000 per year for
       the succeeding fifteen-year carryforward period, for an aggregate
       of $11.2 million, plus NOL attributable to recognized built-in
       gains, limited to $14.0 million by IRC Section 382, for a total
       of $25.2 million.  The financial statement tax benefits arising
       from these NOL carryforwards will be recognized as a reduction in
       financial statement tax expense and an addition to paid-in
       capital in the years utilized.  At October 31, 1995, the Company
       had utilized $18.4 million of the total $25.2 million for Federal
       income tax purposes, including all of the $14.0 million NOL
       attributable to recognized built-in gains.  The remaining
       available NOL is limited to $750,000 per year.

            Effective November 1, 1993, the Company adopted the
       provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
       ("SFAS") Number 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This
       standard requires companies to record all deferred tax
       liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences
       attributable to differences between the financial statement
       carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
       respective tax basis, including tax loss carryforwards.  As
       permitted under SFAS Number 109, prior years' financial
       statements were not restated.  This change did not materially
       affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

            On January 4, 1995, the Company acquired ECD for an
       aggregate purchase price of $3,596,000, which was paid in cash.

            In April 1995, the Company amended its existing line of
       credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Bank"),
       to be an unsecured line of credit up to $15,000,000 and expiring
       April 29, 1997.  Borrowings on the unsecured line of credit bear
       interest at the option of the Company at a per annum rate equal
       to either the Bank's prime rate, or 1.5% over the interest rate
       offered to the Bank in the interbank Eurodollar market, adjusted
       for the Bank's Eurodollar reserve requirements.  At October 31,
       1995, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totalling
       $386,000, which reduced the amount available to the Company under
       the unsecured line of credit to $14,614,000.  See Note 7 - Long-
       Term Debt - Credit Agreement - to the Company's consolidated
       financial statements.  Under the unsecured credit agreement, the
       Company is required to satisfy certain financial and nonfinancial
       covenants.  The Company was in compliance with all financial and
       non-financial covenants contained in the unsecured credit
       agreement at October 31, 1995 and the secured credit agreement at
       October 31, 1994.

            As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business, on December 3,
       1995, the Company and Greiner executed a letter of intent for the
       Company to acquire all the outstanding stock of Greiner pursuant
       to a merger of Greiner with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
       Company.  To finance the cash portion of this proposed
       acquisition, the Company is negotiating to obtain a $20,000,000
       senior secured revolving credit facility expiring three years
       from the closing of the loan (which would replace the unsecured
       line of credit discussed above) and a $50,000,000 senior secured
       term loan maturing six years from the closing of the loan.  See
       Note 7 - Long-Term Debt - Credit Agreement - to the Company's
       consolidated financial statements.

            The Company is a professional services organization and, as
       such, is not capital intensive.  Capital expenditures during
       fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993 were $1,610,000, $2,149,000,
       and $1,952,000, respectively.  The expenditures were principally

                                      -18-

       for computer-aided design and drafting equipment to
       accommodate the Company's growth.  The Company expects 
       fiscal 1996 capital expenditures to be comparable to the
       expenditures in fiscal 1995.

            The Company believes that its existing financial resources,
       together with its planned cash flow from operations and its
       unused line of credit, as well as the contemplated credit
       facilities being negotiated in connection with the proposed
       Greiner acquisition, will provide sufficient capital to fund its
       operations and its capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable
       future.

       ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
                 -------------------------------------------
                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                       ---------------------------------

       The Board of Directors and Stockholders of URS Corporation:

            We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
       of URS Corporation and its subsidiaries as of October 31, 1995
       and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
       changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
       three years in the period ended October 31, 1995.  These
       financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
       management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
       financial statements based on our audits.

            We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
       accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
       plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
       whether the financial statements are free of material
       misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
       evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
       statements.   An audit also includes assessing the accounting
       principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
       well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
       We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
       opinion.

            In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
       present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
       financial position of URS Corporation and its subsidiaries as of
       October 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of their
       operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
       the period ended October 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles.

            As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial
       statements, effective November 1, 1993, the Company adopted
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
       for Income Taxes.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



       NOTE 1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES
                 -------------------
       Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
       -----------------------------------------------------
            The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
       of URS Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-
       owned.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
       have been eliminated in consolidation.

       Revenue Recognition
       -------------------
            Revenue from contract services is recognized by the
       percentage-of-completion method and includes a proportion of the
       earnings expected to be realized on a contract in the ratio that
       costs incurred bear to estimated total costs.  Revenue on cost
       reimbursable contracts is recorded as related contract costs are
       incurred and includes estimated earned fees in the proportion
       that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs.  The
       fees under certain government contracts may be increased or
       decreased in accordance with cost or performance incentive
       provisions which measure actual performance against established
       targets or other criteria.  Such incentive fee awards or
       penalties are included in revenue at the time the amounts can be
       reasonably determined.  Revenue for additional contract
       compensation related to unpriced change orders is recorded when
       realization is probable.  Revenue from claims by the Company for
       additional contract compensation is recorded when agreed to by
       the customer.  If estimated total costs on any contract indicate
       a loss, the Company provides currently for the total loss
       anticipated on the contract.

            Costs under contracts with the U.S. Government are subject
       to government audit upon contract completion.  Therefore, all
       contract costs, including direct and indirect, general and
       administrative expenses, are potentially subject to adjustment
       prior to final reimbursement.  Management believes that adequate
       provision for such adjustments, if any, has been made in the
       accompanying consolidated financial statements.  All overhead and
       general and administrative expense recovery rates for fiscal 1989
       through fiscal 1995 are subject to review by the U.S. Government.

       Cash and Cash Equivalents
       -------------------------
            The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
       original maturities of three months or less to be cash
       equivalents.  Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which
       approximates fair value.

       Income Taxes
       ------------
            Effective November 1, 1993, the Company adopted the
       provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
       ("SFAS") Number 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This
       standard requires companies to record all deferred tax
       liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences
       attributable to differences between the financial statement
       carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
       respective tax basis, including tax loss carryforwards.  As
       permitted under SFAS Number 109, prior years' financial
       statements were not restated.  This did not materially affect the
       Company's consolidated financial statements.

       Depreciation and Amortization
       -----------------------------
            Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over
       the useful service lives of the assets.  Goodwill is amortized on
       the straight-line method ranging from 10 to 20 years.

       Income Per Share
       ----------------
            The computation of earnings per common and common equivalent
       shares is based upon the weighted average number of common shares
       outstanding during the period plus (in periods in which they have
       a dilutive effect) the effect of common shares contingently
       issuable, primarily from stock options, exercise of warrants and
       the potential conversion of convertible debentures, less the
       number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds using
       the average market price of the Company's common stock.

            The fully diluted per share computation reflects the effect
       of common shares contingently issuable upon the exercise of
       warrants in periods in which such exercise would cause dilution. 
       Fully diluted earnings per share may also reflect additional
       dilution related to stock options due to the use of the market
       price at the end of the period when higher than the average price
       for the period.

       NOTE 2.   QUASI-REORGANIZATION
                 --------------------
            In conjunction with a restructuring completed in fiscal year
       1990, the Company, with the approval of its Board of Directors,
       implemented a quasi-reorganization effective February 21, 1990
       and revalued certain assets and liabilities to fair value as of
       that date.
        
            The fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities at
       the date of the quasi-reorganization were determined by
       management to approximate their carrying value and no further
       adjustment of historical bases was required.  No assets were
       written-up in conjunction with the revaluation.  As part of the
       quasi-reorganization, the deficit in retained earnings of
       $92,523,000 was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. 
       The balance in retained earnings at October 31, 1995 represents
       the accumulated net earnings arising subsequent to the date of
       the quasi-reorganization.

       NOTE 3.   ACQUISITION
                 -----------
            During the year ended October 31, 1995, the Company acquired
       E.C. Driver & Associates, Inc. ("ECD") for an aggregate purchase
       price of $3,596,000, and the assumption of ECD's liabilities
       totaling $1,356,000.  This acquisition was accounted for by the
       purchase method of accounting and the net assets of ECD are
       included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of
       October 31, 1995 based upon its estimated fair value at the
       transaction's effective date of January 4, 1995.  Pro forma
       operating results for the years ended October 31, 1994 and 1995,
       as if the acquisition had been made on November 1, 1993, are not
       presented as they would not be materially different from the
       Company's reported results.  The excess of the purchase price

       of $3,596,000 will be amortized on a straight line basis over

       operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards for Federal income tax
       purposes and financial statement purposes of $6,750,000.  The NOL
       utilization is limited to $750,000 per year.

            While the Company has available NOL carryforwards which
       partially off-set otherwise taxable income for Federal income tax
       purposes, for state tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily
       available to offset income subject to tax.  Accordingly, state
       income taxes have been provided.

       Credit Agreement
       ----------------
            At October 31, 1995, the Company's unsecured line of credit
       agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Bank") provides for
       advances up to $15,000,000 and expires April 30, 1997. 
       Borrowings on the line of credit bear interest at the option of
       the Company at a per annum rate equal to either the Bank's prime
       rate, or 1.5% over the interest rate offered to the Bank in the
       interbank Eurodollar market, adjusted for the Bank's Eurodollar
       reserve requirements.  At October 31, 1995, the Company had
       outstanding letters of credit totalling $386,000 which reduced
       the amount available to the Company under its unsecured line of
       credit to $14,614,000.

            To finance the cash portion of the proposed Greiner
       acquisition (discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business and Note
       16 - Subsequent Event), the Company is negotiating to obtain a
       $20,000,000 senior secured revolving credit facility expiring
       three years from the closing of the loan and a $50,000,000 senior
       secured term loan maturing six years from the closing of the
       loan.  The senior secured revolving credit facility would replace
       the current unsecured line of credit.

            Under the unsecured line of credit agreement the Company is
       required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial
       covenants.  The declaration of dividends, except stock dividends,
       is restricted by the terms of the Company's credit agreement with
       the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Bank")  and the
       indenture governing the 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures due
       2004 (the "8-5/8 Indenture"), described below. The Company was in
       compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants related
       to the unsecured line of credit agreement at October 31, 1995 and
       to the secured line of credit agreement October 31, 1994.

       Related Parties
       ---------------
            At October 31, 1995, the Company had fully drawn $4,000,000 
       under its line of credit with Richard C. Blum & Associates, L.P. 
       ("RCBA").  This indebtedness is represented by the January Notes, 
       which bear interest at 6-1/2% per annum, are subordinate only to 
       the Bank line of credit and are due November 1, 2000.  RCBA, 
       through various partnerships, beneficially owns approximately 22% 
       of the Company's common shares (approximately 34% assuming 
       exercise of additional warrants) outstanding at October 31, 1995.  
       Richard C. Blum, a director of the Company, is also Chairman of 
       RCBA.

       Debentures
       ----------
            The Company's 6-1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
       2012 are convertible into the Company's common shares at the rate
       of $206.30 per share.  Sinking fund payments are calculated to
       retire 70% of the debentures prior to maturity beginning in
       February 1998.  Interest is payable semi-annually in February and
       August.  Interest is payable semi-annually in January and July on
       the Company's 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2004.  Both 
       the 6-1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures and the 8-5/8% 
       Senior Subordinated Debentures are subordinate to all debt to 
       RCBA and the Bank.

            The amounts of long-term debt outstanding at October 31,
       1995 maturing in the next five years are as follows:

       Obligations under Leases
       ------------------------
            Total rental expense included in operations for operating
       leases for the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
       amounted to $5,717,000, $5,275,000 and $4,938,000, respectively.
       Certain of the lease rentals are subject to renewal options and
       escalation based upon property taxes and operating expenses. 
       These operating lease agreements expire at varying dates through
       2005.

            Obligations under non-cancelable lease agreements are as
       follows:

       NOTE 8.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
                 -----------------------------
            Currently, the Company has $31,000,000 per occurrence and
       aggregate commercial general liability insurance coverage.  The
       Company is also insured for professional errors and omissions
       ("E&O") and pollution liability ("EIL") claims with an aggregate
       limit of $25,000,000 after a self-insured deductible of $500,000. 
       The E&O and EIL coverages are on a "claims made" basis, covering
       only claims actually made during the policy period currently in
       effect.  Thus, if the Company does not continue to maintain this
       policy, it will have no coverage under the policy for claims made
       after its termination date even if the occurrence was during the
       term of coverage.  It is the Company's intent to maintain this
       type of coverage, but there can be no assurance that the Company
       can maintain its existing coverage, that claims will not exceed
       the amount of insurance coverage or that there will not be claims
       relating to prior periods that were subject only to "claims made"
       coverage.

            Various legal proceedings are pending against the Company or
       its subsidiaries alleging breaches of contract or negligence in
       connection with the performance of professional services.  In
       some actions punitive or treble damages are sought which
       substantially exceed the Company's insurance coverage.  The
       Company's management does not believe that any of such
       proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the
       consolidated financial position and operations of the Company.

       NOTE 9.   CAPITAL STOCK
                 -------------
            Declaration of dividends, except Common Stock dividends, is
       restricted by the unsecured line of credit agreement and the
       8-5/8 Indenture.  Further, declaration of dividends may be
       precluded by existing Delaware law.

            During fiscal year 1995, the Company repurchased a total of
       42,000 shares of its Common Stock at an average repurchase price
       of $5.43, pursuant to a systematic repurchase plan approved by
       the Company's Board of Directors on September 13, 1994.

            The 1987 Restricted Stock Plan (the "Plan") provides for
       grants of up to 16,537 shares of Common Stock to key employees of
       the Company and its subsidiaries.  An employee selected to
       receive shares under the Plan will not be required to pay any
       consideration for the shares.  Shares issued to an employee are
       subject to forfeiture in the event that the employment of the
       employee terminates for any reason other than death.  The
       forfeiture restrictions lapse with respect to portions of the
       grant over a five-year period subsequent to the grant date.  As
       of October 31, 1995, 6,872 restricted shares have been granted.

            The 1979 Stock Option Plan (the "1979 Plan") provided for
       grants of options to purchase shares of Common Stock to
       directors, officers and key employees of the Company and its
       subsidiaries at prices and for periods (not to exceed ten years)
       as determined by the Board of Directors.  The 1979 Plan also
       provided for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights and
       incentive stock options.  The 1979 Plan expired in February 1989,
       and no further options or rights may be granted under the 1979
       Plan.

            On October 20, 1988, the stockholders approved a replacement
       option program pursuant to which non-management members of the
       Board of Directors granted replacement stock options to selected
       employees, exercisable at then current market prices.  The
       selected employees then exchanged their outstanding options for
       new options covering two shares for each three shares covered by
       the options being replaced.  Options to purchase 16,561 shares
       were exchanged for pre-existing options.

            On April 27, 1989, the stockholders approved the 1989 Stock
       Option and Rights Plan (the "1989 Plan").  The 1989 Plan provides
       for the grant of options to purchase 50,000 shares of Common
       Stock to directors, officers and key employees of the Company and
       its subsidiaries at prices and for periods (not to exceed ten
       years) as determined by the Board of Directors.  The 1989 Plan
       also provides for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights.  No
       options have been granted under the 1989 Plan.

            On March 26, 1991, the stockholders approved the 1991 Stock
       Incentive Plan (the "1991 Plan").  The 1991 Plan provides for the
       grant not to exceed 1,500,000 Restricted Shares, Stock Units and
       Options, plus the number of shares of Common Stock remaining
       available for awards under the 1987 Plan (9,665) and the 1989
       Plan (50,000) to key employees of the Company and its subsidi-
       aries at prices and for periods as determined by the Board of
       Directors.  The 1991 Plan prohibits granting new options under


                                      -36-

       the 1987 Plan and the 1989 Plan.  As of October 1995, the Company
       had issued 21,200 shares of Restricted Stock under the 1991 Plan.

            Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan")
       implemented in September 1985, employees may purchase shares of
       Common Stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of the
       employee's base pay.  Contributions are credited to each
       participant's account on the last day of each six-month
       participation period of the ESP Plan (which commences on January
       1 and July 1 of each year).  The purchase price for each share of
       Common Stock shall be the lower of 85% of the fair market value
       of such share on the last trading day before the participation
       period commences or 85% of the fair market value of such share on
       the last trading day in the participation period.  The ESP Plan
       was suspended effective September 19, 1988.  On March 24, 1992,
       the stockholders approved reinstating the ESP Plan.  Employees
       purchased 46,610 shares under the ESP Plan in fiscal 1995 and
       36,195 shares in fiscal 1994. 

            On February 21, 1990, the Company issued warrants to
       purchase 1,819,148 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of
       $4.34 per share which expire on February 14, 1997.

            A summary of the number of stock options granted under the
       1979, 1989 and 1991 Plans is as follows:

       1994 and 1993, respectively.  (See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt).

            The Company has agreements for business consulting services
       to be provided by RCBA and Richard C. Blum, a Director of the
       Company.  Under these agreements, the Company paid $90,000 and
       $60,000 to RCBA and Richard C. Blum, respectively, for fiscal
       1995, 1994 and 1993.  Richard C. Blum also received an additional
       $25,000, $24,000 and $19,000 for his services as a Director of
       the Company in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In

       owned subsidiary of the Company ("URSC"), performed an
       underground storage tank remediation investigation on behalf of

       NOTE 14.   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
                  ----------------------------
            The Company provides services primarily to local, state and
       Federal government agencies.  The Company believes the credit
       risk associated with these types of revenues is minimal. 
       However, the Company does perform ongoing credit evaluations of
       its customers and, generally, requires no collateral.  The
       Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such
       losses have been within management's expectations.

       NOTE 16.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT
                  ----------------
            Subsequent to the Company's year-end, a letter of intent was
       signed to acquire Greiner Engineering, Inc. for a combination
       cash and stock transaction aggregating $63.4 million in cash, and
       1.4 million shares of the Company's Common Stock.  Completion of
       this transaction is subject to a number of conditions including a
       satisfactory due diligence review, mutual approval of a formal
       purchase agreement, and shareholder, regulatory and other
       approvals.  The completion of this transaction is anticipated by
       April, 1996.  The completion of the cash portion of this
       acquisition will necessitate financing via a revolving credit
       facility and senior secured term loan, increasing the Company's
       debt and interest expense.  The Company is negotiating a banking
       agreement which secures adequate and appropriate financing for
       this acquisition as well as other future growth opportunities.

            -    Provide significant award potential for achieving
                 outstanding performance; and

            -    Enhance the ability of URS to attract and retain highly
                 talented and competent individuals.

                          Page 58 of 106                  <PAGE>

       II.1 GENERAL PLAN DESCRIPTION
            ------------------------
       The Plan provides the opportunity for key Employees of URS to
       receive cash Awards based on a combination of URS's and
       individual performance.

       Here is an overview of how the Plan works.  In general, certain
       Employees will be selected to participate in the Plan at the
       beginning of or during the Plan Year.  These individuals are
       referred to as "Designated Participants."  Upon selection to
       participate in the Plan, each Designated Participant will be
       assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This Target Award
       Percentage, multiplied by the Participant's Base Salary earned
       during the Plan Year, will equal the Participant's Target Award. 
       This Target Award represents the amount that is expected to be
       paid to a Designated Participant if certain financial Performance
       Objectives for URS have been fully met.

       In addition, funds will be set aside for discretionary Awards to
       selected other Employees (referred to as "Non-designated
       Participants"), who have demonstrated outstanding individual
       performance during the Plan Year.  It is expected that the amount
       available to Non-designated Participants for the 1995 Plan Year
       will be $25,000, assuming that URS meets its financial
       objectives.

       The sum of all Target Awards for Designated Participants and
       expected payouts to Non-designated Participants will equal the
       Target Bonus Pool.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the
       Target Pool upward or downward based on URS's actual performance
       in relationship to its Performance Objectives.

       Actual Awards to Designated Participants and actual funds
       available for distribution to Non-designated Participants will
       vary from target amounts based on the relationship between the
       Actual Bonus Pool and the Target Bonus Pool.

       A detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the
       following sections of this document.

       II.2 DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS
            ------------------------------------------
       Plan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the
       opinion of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of URS, have the
       opportunity to significantly impact the annual operating success
       of the Company.  These Employees are the Designated Participants
       and will be notified in writing of their selection to participate
       in the Plan.  This notification letter, for all Participants
       except the CEO of URS, will be signed by the CEO of URS.  The
       letter of participation for the CEO will be signed by the
       Chairman of the Compensation/Option Committee ("Committee") of
       URS's Board of Directors.


                                      II-1




                          Page 59 of 106                  <PAGE>

       In addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group
       of other Employees who are selected to receive Awards based on
       their outstanding individual performance during the Plan Year. 
       These other Employees are the Non-designated Participants and
       will not be selected until the completion of the Plan Year.  The
       selection of Non-designated Participants will be determined by
       the CEO of URS at his sole discretion. 

       II.3 TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS
            ----------------------------------------------------
       Each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award
       Percentage.  This Target Award Percentage, when multiplied by the
       individual's Base Salary earned during the Plan Year, represents
       the anticipated payout to a Designated Participant if URS's
       Performance Objectives are met.

       Each Designated Participant's Target Award Percentage will be
       included in the letter of notification mentioned in Section II.2.

       II.4 TARGET BONUS POOL
            -----------------
       The Target Bonus Pool ("Target Pool") will equal the sum of all
       Target Awards for Designated Participants plus an amount set
                                                 ----
       aside for possible distribution to Non-designated Participants. 
       For 1995, the Target Bonus Pool equals $355,000.

       II.5 URS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
            --------------------------
       For 1995, URS's Performance Objectives are focused on the need to
       reach the Company's Target for Net Income.  The Performance
       Objectives and weightings for the 1995 Plan Year are as follows:

             URS Corporation Performance Objectives and Weightings

       Performance Measure      Weighting      Performance Objective
       -------------------      ---------      ---------------------
       Net Income ($000s)         100%              $4,800


       Net Income will be calculated after all URS and URS Consultants
                                     -----         ---
       ("URSC") bonuses are accrued and assumed to have been paid.

       II.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL
            ----------------------------------------------------------
       The Actual Bonus Pool ("Actual Pool") will vary from the Target
       Pool based on the relationship between the actual performance of
       URS and the Performance Objectives.  The Actual Pool will vary in
       relationship to the Target Pool based on the following table:



                                      II-2

                          75%            $ 3,600            30%
                       <  75%         <  $ 3,600             0%

       [FN]

       <F1> The calculation of the Actual Award as a percent of Target
            will be interpolated for performance between discrete points
            on a straight-line basis.

       Based on the table above, the Actual Award will vary depending
       upon actual performance in relation to Target Net Income.  

       II.7 ACTUAL AWARDS TO DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS
            -----------------------------------------------------------
       Actual Awards to Designated Participants will vary from Target
       levels based on the relationship between the Actual Bonus Pool
       and the Target Pool.

       After allocating Actual Awards to Designated Participants, the
       remaining funds in the Actual Pool will be available for
       allocation to Non-designated Participants.

       Actual Awards distributed to Non-designated Participants will be
       determined on a discretionary basis by the CEO.  URS is under no
       obligation to distribute any or all of the Actual Pool.  The sum
       of all Awards to Non-designated Participants may not exceed the
       amount available in the Actual Pool after Actual Awards have been
       allocated to Designated Participants.

                      EXAMPLE OF INTERPOLATION CALCULATION
                     ------------------------------------

       To interpolate the Actual Award based on performance, apply the
       appropriate formula for actual performance above or below the
       Performance Objective.  In all cases, solve for "X".

       -    For performance above Objective:

       (Act. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)                     X              
       -------------------------    =   -------------------------------
       (Max. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)        (Max. Award % - Target Award %)

                    EXAMPLE OF ACTUAL BONUS POOL CALCULATION

       The following example illustrates the weighting of the
       Performance Objectives, and calculates the Actual Bonus Pool:

       Hypothetical Assumptions:
       -    Target Bonus Pool =                            $  355,000

       -    Net Income Objective (after bonus accrual) =   $4,800,000
       -    Actual Net Income (after bonus accrual) =      $4,600,000


       Interpolation:
       -    Net Income Performance =                            88.3%

       Actual Bonus Pool =                                 $  313,000

                          Page 63 of 106                  <PAGE>

       III.1  AWARD PAYMENT
              -------------
       Assessment of actual performance and payout of Awards will be
       subject to the completion of the 1995 Year-end independent audit.

       The Actual Award earned, up to and in excess of the Target Award
       level, will be paid to the Participant (or the Participant's
       heirs in the case of death) in cash within 30 days of the
       completion of the independent audit.  Payroll and other taxes
       will be withheld as required by law.

       III.2  EMPLOYMENT
              ----------
       In order to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must
       be employed by URS or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year,
       except as otherwise noted below.  Selection for participation in
       the Plan does not convey any employment rights.  Terms and
       conditions of Participants' employment agreements with URS, if
       any, supersede the terms and conditions of the Plan.

       III.3  TERMINATION
              -----------
       If Termination of a Designated Participant's employment occurs
       during the Plan Year by reason of death, permanent disability, or
       retirement, the Designated Participant (or the Participant's
       heirs in the case of death) will be eligible to receive a pro-
       rata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
       Objectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who have
       earned an Award on this basis will receive payment on the same
       schedule as other Plan Participants. 

       A Participant whose employment with URS or its Affiliates is
       terminated prior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason
       (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) will forfeit the
       opportunity to earn an Award under the Plan, except as otherwise
       provided for.

       III.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS
              ---------------------
       Individuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan
       participation and who have a minimum of three months as a
       Designated Participant will be eligible to receive a pro-rata
       Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
       Objectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the
       Participant is employed by URS or an Affiliate at Year-end.


       III.5  PLAN FUNDING
              ------------
       Estimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and
       charged as an expense against the income statement of URS.  At
       the end of each fiscal quarter, the estimated Actual Awards under


                                     III-1




                          Page 64 of 106                  <PAGE>

       the Plan will be evaluated based on actual performance to date. 
       The monthly accrual rate will then be adjusted so that the cost
       of the Plan is fully accrued at Year-end.

       Accrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards
       to Participants.

       III.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION
              -------------------
       Responsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding
       Plan administration are divided among the URS CEO and the
       Committee.  Section III.7 outlines the levels of responsibility
       and authority assigned to each.

       Notwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority
       regarding all aspects of Plan administration, and the resolution
       of any disputes.  The Committee may, without notice, amend,
       suspend or revoke the Plan.

       III.8  ASSIGNMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
              -----------------------------
       No employee has a claim or right to be a Participant in the Plan,
       to continue as a Participant, or to be granted an Award under the
       Plan.  URS is not obligated to give uniform treatment (e.g.,
       Target Award Percentages, discretionary Awards, etc.) to
       Employees or Participants under the Plan.  Participation in the
       Plan does not give an Employee the right to be retained in the
       employment of URS, nor does it imply or confer any other
       employment rights.

       Nothing contained in the Plan will be construed to create a
       contract of employment with any Participant.  URS reserves the
       right to elect any person to its offices and to remove Employees
       in any manner and upon any basis permitted by law.

       Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed to require URS to
       deposit, invest or set aside amounts for the payment of any
       Awards.  Participation in the Plan does not give a Participant
       any ownership, security, or other rights in any assets of URS or
       any of its Affiliates.

       III.9  WITHHOLDING TAX
              ---------------
       URS will deduct from all Awards paid under the Plan any taxes
       required by law to be withheld.

       III.10 EFFECTIVE DATE
              --------------
       The Plan is effective as of November 1, 1994, and will remain in
       effect for the Fiscal Year ending October 31, 1995 unless
       otherwise terminated or extended by the Committee.

       III.11 VALIDITY
              --------
       In the event any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or
       unenforceable, the same will not affect, in any respect
       whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of the Plan.

       III.12 APPLICABLE LAW
              --------------
       The Plan will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
       laws of the State of California.

       II.1 GENERAL PLAN DESCRIPTION 
            ------------------------
       The Plan provides the opportunity for key Employees of URS
       Consultants, Inc. ("URSC") to receive cash Awards based on a
       combination of URSC and individual performance.  

       Here is an overview of how the Plan works.  In general, a Target
       Bonus Pool is established.  This amount represents the total
       Awards that are expected to be paid to selected URSC Employees if
       certain financial Performance Objectives for URSC have been fully
       met.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool
       upward or downward based on URSC actual performance in
       relationship to its Performance Objectives.  This adjusted bonus
       pool is the Actual Bonus Pool, from which Actual Award payouts
       will be made.  

       At the beginning of or during the Plan Year, certain Employees
       will be selected to participate in the Plan.  These individuals
       are referred to as "Designated Participants."  Upon selection to
       participate in the Plan, each Designated Participant will be
       assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This Target Award
       Percentage, multiplied by the Participant's Base Salary earned
       during the Plan Year, will equal the Participant's Target Award. 
       This Target Award will be earned for meeting both pre-determined
       URSC and individual Performance Objectives.  Individual
       Performance Objectives will vary based on the Participant's role
       within the organization.  Each Designated Participant's Actual
       Award could vary from the Target Award, based on the individual's
       actual performance measured against his/her Performance
       Objectives, subject to the amount available for distribution from
       the Actual Bonus Pool.

       Another key feature of the Plan is that a portion of the Actual
       Bonus Pool will be set aside for discretionary Awards to selected
       other Employees (referred to in the Plan as "Non-Designated
       Participants"), who have demonstrated outstanding individual
       performance during the Plan Year. 

       A detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the
       following sections of this document. 

       II.2 DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS
            ------------------------------------------
       Plan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the
       opinion of the President of URSC and the Chief Executive Officer
       ("CEO") of URS Corporation (the "Parent Company"), have the
       opportunity to significantly impact the annual operating success
       of URSC.  These Employees are the Designated Participants and
       will be notified in writing of their selection to participate in
       the Plan.  This notification letter will be signed by both the
       President of URSC and the CEO of the Parent Company.



                                      II-1

       In addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group
       of other Employees who are selected to receive Awards based on
       their outstanding individual performance during the Plan Year. 
       These other Employees are the Non-designated Participants and
       will not be selected until the completion of the Plan Year.  The
       selection of Non-designated Participants will be determined by
       the President of URSC, subject to the approval of the CEO of the
       Parent Company, at their sole discretion. 

       II.3 TARGET BONUS POOL
            -----------------
       A Target Bonus Pool is established, equal to the sum of all
       target awards for Designated Participants plus an amount set
       aside for possible distribution to Non-designated Participants.
       (The Awards to Non-designated Participants are estimated at
       approximately 25% of the total Designated Participants' Bonus
       Pool.)

       This Target Bonus Pool is determined based on the current group
       of Designated Participants and the anticipated group of Non-
       designated Participants.  The Target Pool is subject to change if
       the group of Designated Participants, the group of Non-
       Designated Participants, or the Base Salaries of Designated
       Participants change.

       Subject to these potential changes, the Target Bonus Pool for the
       1995 Plan Year is established at $1,425,000.

       II.4 URSC PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
            ---------------------------
       URSC Performance Objectives are focused on the need to achieve
       strong operating results (i.e., contribution), generate cash
       through the management of accounts receivables (DSOs) throughout
       the Year and develop new business opportunities.  Accordingly,
       performance will be evaluated based on a combination of URSC
       Contribution, Average Receivables Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
       and New Sales. 

















                                      II-2




                          Page 78 of 106                  <PAGE>

       The URSC Performance Objectives for the 1995 Plan Year are as
       follows:

                          URSC Performance Objectives
                          ---------------------------
            Performance Measures          Performance Objectives
            --------------------          ----------------------
            Contribution ($000s)                 $12,603
            Average DSO (Days)                      94
            New Sales ($000s)                   $187,055


       URSC Contribution is defined as total 1995 Fiscal Year URSC
       revenues less:

            -    Direct cost of sales;
            -    Indirect expenses; and
            -    Accrual of expected Awards for both Designated and
                 Non-designated Participants under the Plan (i.e., the
                 Plan must pay for itself)

       The subtraction of expected Awards from revenues in calculating
       contribution under the Plan means that the Contribution
       Objective, for purposes of the Plan, is calculated after all
                                                          -----
       bonuses have been accrued, or assumed to have been paid.   

       URSC Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is defined by the following
       formula:

                 BAR + UAR - BEC
                 ---------------  X  90
                    REVENUES

       where BAR is billed accounts receivable, UAR is unbilled accounts
       receivable, BEC is billings in excess of cost, and REVENUES is
       the sum of the last three months revenues.  DSOs will be
       calculated monthly, and the average of the twelve months' DSOs
       will equal Average DSOs.

       URSC New Sales is defined as gross additions to backlog.


       II.5 WEIGHTING OF URSC PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES 
            ----------------------------------------
       The Target Bonus Pool will be weighted based on the aggregate
       weightings of the individual Participants' Performance Objectives
       in the Plan.  Contribution will be the most heavily weighted
       component followed by DSO performance and New Sales.   An example
       of the weighting calculation is shown below.




                                      II-3

                     EXAMPLE OF WEIGHTING CALCULATION <F1>
                     -------------------------------------

       The Target Bonus Pool will be weighted based on the aggregate
       weightings of the individual Performance Objectives for the
       Designated Participants in the Plan.  The following example
       illustrates the weighting calculation:



                 Target Bonus Pool =          $1,425,000


                 Portion of Target Pool
                 determined by:

                 Contribution (69%)             $988,000

                 DSO Performance (17%)          $238,000

                 New Sales (14%)                $199,000


       [FN]

       <F1>      Weightings may be subject to change based on the Plan
                 measures of the Designated Participants at the end of
                 the Plan Year.

       II.6      RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS
                 POOL
                 -----------------------------------------------------
       The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool based
       on the relationship between the actual performance of URSC and
       the Performance Objectives.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary in
       relationship to the Target Bonus Pool based on the following
       table:

       [FN]
       <F1> Maximum upside opportunity of 200% of the Target Bonus Pool
       may be raised at the discretion of the Compensation/Option
       Committee ("Committee") of the Parent Company Board of Directors. 
       The calculation of the Actual Bonus Pool As A % Of Target will be
       interpolated for performance between discrete points shown in the
       table above.

       Based on the table above, the Actual Bonus Pool could vary
       between 0% and 200% of the Target Bonus Pool, depending upon
       actual performance in relation to Performance Objectives and the
       weighting of the Performance Objectives.  Accrual of any Actual

       Pool tied to DSO and New Sales is contingent upon Contribution
       performance being at or above 75% of the Performance Objective.

       Here is an example of the calculation of an Actual Bonus pool:

                      EXAMPLE OF INTERPOLATION CALCULATION
                      ------------------------------------
       To interpolate the Actual Award based on performance, apply the
       appropriate formula for actual performance above or below the
       Performance Objective.  In all cases, solve for "X".

       -    For performance above objective:
       (Act. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)                         X
       -------------------------       =   -----------------------------
       (Max. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)           (Max. Award% - Target Award%)

       -    For performance below objective:
       (Act. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)                         X
       -------------------------       =   -----------------------------
       (Min. Perf. - Perf. Obj.)           (Min. Award% - Target Award%)

       -    Once you have solved for "X", add X to 100%.

       Below is a hypothetical example:

                    EXAMPLE OF ACTUAL BONUS POOL CALCULATION
                    ----------------------------------------
       The following example illustrates the weighting of the
       Performance Objectives and calculates the Actual Bonus Pool:

       Hypothetical assumptions:
       -    Target Bonus Pool =                             $1,425,000

             URSC 1995 Performance         Objective            Actual
             ---------------------         ---------            ------
       -    Contribution                     $12,603           $13,200
       -    DSO Performance                  94 Days           93 Days
       -    New Sales                       $187,055          $170,000

       Weighting:
       -    Contribution portion of Target Pool =             $988,000
       -    DSO portion of Target Pool =                      $238,000
       -    New Sales portion of Target Pool =                $199,000

       Interpolation:
       -    Contribution Performance =                          119.0%
       -    DSO Performance =                                   120.0%
       -    New Sales Performance =                              64.0%

       Actual Bonus Pool =                                  $1,588,680
       ($988,000 * 119.0%) + ($238,000 * 120.0%) +
       ($199,000 *  64.0%)

                          Page 82 of 106                  <PAGE>

       II.7   DISCRETIONARY BONUS POOL
              ------------------------
       It is the intent of the Plan that if the Actual Bonus Pool, as
       calculated in Section II.6, should fall below 30% of the Target
       Bonus Pool, then a Discretionary Bonus Pool will be created
       instead.

       Awards from the Discretionary Pool may be made to selected
       Employees (both Designated and Non-designated Participants). 
       Awards to Designated Participants will be calculated based on
       actual performance, reduced pro rata based on the amount of the
       Discretionary Pool.  Awards to Non-designated Participants will
       be made on a totally discretionary basis by the President of
       URSC, subject to the approval of the CEO of the Parent Company. 
       The formation of the Discretionary Pool will not guarantee any
       Award payments.  Rather, the Discretionary Pool will be used to
       recognize selected outstanding Employees in the event that URSC
       does not meet or exceed 75% of its Contribution Performance
       Objective.  The total sum of Awards made from the Discretionary
       Pool may not exceed 30% of the total Target Bonus Pool.

       II.8   ACTUAL BONUS POOL ALLOCATION
              ----------------------------
       Awards will be paid from the funds available in the Actual Bonus
       Pool.  The portion of the pool actually allocated to Non-
       Designated Participants will be determined after the end of the
       Plan Year at the discretion of the CEO of the Parent Company,
       subject to the approval of the Committee, and may vary from the
       estimated 20% of the total Actual Bonus Pool.  The sum of the
       Actual Awards paid, including Awards made to Non-designated
       Participants, may not exceed the available Actual Bonus Pool.

       II.9   TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES
              ------------------------
       Each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award
       Percentage.  This Target Award Percentage, when multiplied by the
       individual's Base Salary earned during the Plan Year, represents
       the anticipated payout to a Designated Participant if all of the
       URSC and the individual's Performance Objectives are met. Each
       Designated Participant's Target Award Percentage and individual
       Performance Objectives will be included in the letter of
       notification mentioned in Section II.2.

       II.10  ACTUAL AWARDS FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS 
              -----------------------------------------
       Individual Performance Objectives will be assigned based on the
       economic unit (i.e., URSC, a region of URSC, or an office of
       URSC) on which the Participant's performance has the greatest
       financial impact.  Each Designated Participant will be notified
       of his/her economic unit, the individual Performance Objectives
       associated with that unit, the weighting of those Performance
       Objectives, and the relationship between individual unit


                                      II-7




                          Page 83 of 106                  <PAGE>

       performance and Award levels in the letter of notification
       mentioned in Section II.2.

       II.11  ADJUSTMENT TO ACTUAL AWARDS
              ---------------------------
       It is possible that the sum of the Actual Awards for Designated
       Participants could exceed the Actual Bonus Pool available for
       Designated Participants.  This result could happen for either one
       of two reasons.  First, the CEO of the Parent Company could
       allocate more for Awards to Non-designated Participants than was
       accrued.  Second, larger economic units could perform worse
       relative to the smaller economic units, creating an insufficient
       Actual Bonus Pool.  In these cases, all Actual Awards will be
       reduced pro-rata by a factor determined by dividing the Actual
       Bonus Pool for Designated Participants by the sum of the
       individual Actual Awards for Designated Participants.  

       If the sum of Actual Awards is less than the Actual Bonus Pool
       available for Designated Participants, there will be no upward
       pro-ration of Awards paid.

                          Page 85 of 106                  <PAGE>

       III.1  AWARD PAYMENT
              -------------
       Assessment of actual performance and payout of Awards will be
       subject to the completion of the 1995 Year-end independent audit.

       The Actual Award earned, up to and in excess of the Target Award
       level, will be paid to the Participant (or the Participant's
       heirs in the case of death) in cash within 30 days of the
       completion of the independent audit.  Payroll and other taxes
       will be withheld as required by law.

       III.2  EMPLOYMENT 
              ----------
       To receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must be
       employed by URSC or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year,
       except as otherwise noted below.  A Participant must also have
       performed his/her duties satisfactorily during the Year, as
       determined by the URSC President.  The Parent Company CEO will
       assess the performance of the President and Executive Vice
       President.

       III.3  TERMINATION
              -----------
       If Termination of a Designated Participant's employment occurs
       during the Plan Year by reason of death, permanent disability, or
       retirement, the Designated Participant (or the Participant's
       heirs in the case of death) will be eligible to receive a pro-
       rata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
       Objectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who have
       earned an Award on this basis will receive payment on the same
       schedule as other Plan Participants.  

       A Participant whose employment with URSC or its Affiliates is
       terminated prior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason
       (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) will forfeit the
       opportunity to earn an Award under the Plan.

       III.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS
              ---------------------
       Individuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan
       participation and who have a minimum of three months as a
       Designated Participant will be eligible to receive a pro-rata
       Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the
       Objectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the
       Participant is employed by URSC or an Affiliate at Year-end.  

       III.5  PLAN FUNDING
              ------------
       Estimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and
       charged as an expense against the income statement of URSC and
       its economic units.  At the end of each fiscal quarter, the
       estimated Actual Bonus Pool under the Plan will be evaluated


                                     III-1




                          Page 86 of 106                  <PAGE>

       based on actual performance to date.  The monthly accrual rate
       will then be adjusted so that the cost of the Plan is fully
       accrued at Year-end.

       Accrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards
       to Participants.  

       III.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION
              -------------------
       Responsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding
       Plan administration are divided among the URSC President, the
       Parent Company CEO, and the Committee.  Section III.7 outlines
       the levels of responsibility and authority assigned to each.  

       Notwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority
       regarding all aspects of Plan administration, and the resolution
       of any disputes.  The Committee may, without notice, amend,

       No employee has a claim or right to be a Participant in the Plan,
       to continue as a Participant, or to be granted an Award under the
       Plan.  URSC is not obligated to give uniform treatment (e.g.,
       Target Award Percentages, discretionary Awards, etc.) to
       Employees or Participants under the Plan.  Participation in the
       Plan does not give an Employee the right to be retained in the
       employment of URSC, nor does it imply or confer any other
       employment rights.

       Nothing contained in the Plan will be construed to create a
       contract of employment with any Participant.  URSC reserves the
       right to elect any person to its offices and to remove Employees
       in any manner and upon any basis permitted by law.

       Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed to require URSC to
       deposit, invest or set aside amounts for the payment of any
       Awards.  Participation in the Plan does not give a Participant
       any ownership, security, or other rights in any assets of URSC or
       any of its Affiliates.

       III.9   WITHHOLDING TAX
               ---------------
       URSC will deduct from all Awards paid under the Plan any taxes
       required by law to be withheld.

       III.10  EFFECTIVE DATE
               --------------
       The Plan is effective as of November 1, 1994, and shall remain in
       effect for the Fiscal Year ending October 31, 1995 unless
       otherwise terminated or extended by the Committee.

       III.11  VALIDITY
               --------
       In the event any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or
       unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect
       whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of the Plan.

       III.12  APPLICABLE LAW
               --------------
       The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
       the laws of the State of California.

                     EXAMPLE OF WEIGHTING CALCULATION <F1>
                     -------------------------------------


       The Target Bonus Pool will be weighted based on the aggregate
       weightings of the individual Performance Objectives for the
       Designated Participants in the Plan.  The following example
       illustrates the weighting calculation:



         Target Bonus Pool =                               $1,425,000

         Portion of Target Pool
         determined by:

         Contribution (69%)                                  $988,000

         DSO Performance (17%)                               $238,000

         New Sales (14%)                                     $199,000


       [FN]

       <F1> Weightings may be subject to change based on the Plan
            measures of the Designated Participants at the end of the
            Plan Year.

                    EXAMPLE OF ACTUAL BONUS POOL CALCULATION
                    ----------------------------------------


       The following example illustrates the weighting of the
       Performance Objectives and calculates the Actual Bonus Pool:

       Hypothetical assumptions:
       - Target Bonus Pool =                               $1,425,000

       - DSO Performance                       94 Days        93 Days

       - New Sales                            $187,055       $170,000

       Weighting:
       - Contribution portion of Target Pool =               $988,000
       - DSO portion of Target Pool =                        $238,000
       - New Sales portion of Target Pool =                  $199,000

       Interpolation:
       - Contribution Performance =                            119.0%
       - DSO Performance =                                     120.0%
       - New Sales Performance =                                64.0%

       Actual Bonus Pool =                                 $1,588,680

         ($988,000 * 119.0%) + ($238,000 * 120.0%) +

                       EXAMPLE OF ACTUAL AWARD ADJUSTMENT
                       ----------------------------------

       The following example illustrates the Actual Award adjustment
       that occurs if the sum of the individual Actual Awards is greater
       than the Actual Bonus Pool:

       Hypothetical assumptions:

       - Target Bonus Pool =                               $1,425,000

       - Actual Bonus Pool =                               $1,588,680

       - Sum of individual Actual Awards
           (as calculated) =                               $2,400,000

       - Actual Awards (as calculated)
         -  Participant A =                                   $15,750
         -  Participant B =                                   $30,000


       Pro-rata reduction factor =                    
         ($1,588,680 / $2,400,000) =                             .662

       Individual Awards (after reduction)
       - Participant A =
         ($15,750 * .662) =                                   $10,427

       - Participant B =

                              SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
                              -------------------

            THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of November 22, 1993, by
       and between JOSEPH MASTERS (the "Employee") and URS CORPORATION,
                   --------------                      ---------------
       a Delaware corporation (the "Company").


                 1.   Term.
                      ----
                 This Agreement shall be in effect as long as the
       Employee is continuously employed by the Company.

                 2.   Severance Pay.
                      -------------
                 (a)  CONTINUATION PERIOD.  If the Company terminates
       the Employee's employment for any reason other than Cause or if,
       within one year after a Change in Control, the Employee
       voluntarily resigns his employment with the Company for Good
       Reason, then the Employee shall be entitled to receive all of the
       payments and benefit coverage described in this Section 2. 
       Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (d) below, such
       payments and benefit coverage shall continue for the period
       commencing on the date when the employment termination is
       effective and ending on the earlier of (i) the date six months
       after the date when the employment termination is effective or
       (ii) the date of the Employee's death (the "Continuation
       Period").

                 (b)  BASE SALARY.  During the Continuation Period, the
       Company shall pay the Employee, in accordance with its standard
       payroll procedures, his base salary at the rate in effect on the
       date of the employment termination.

                 (c)  INSURANCE COVERAGE.  During the Continuation
       Period, the Employee (and, where applicable, his dependents)
       shall be entitled to continue participation in all insurance or
       similar plans maintained by the Company, including (without
       limitation) life, disability, health and accident insurance
       programs, on the terms that would apply if he were still an
       employee of the Company.  Where applicable, the Employee's salary
       for purposes of such plans shall be deemed to be equal to his
       base salary.  To the extent that the Company finds that it is not
       reasonably practicable to cover the Employee under its group
       insurance policies during the Continuation Period, the Company
       shall provide the Employee with an equivalent level of coverage
       under individual policies.  The Company shall contribute to the
       cost of such individual policies the amount it would have




                                      -1-



                          Page 97 of 106                  <PAGE>

       contributed under its group insurance policies, and the Employee
       shall pay the balance of the cost (if any).

                 (d)  MITIGATION REQUIRED.  The payments contemplated by
       Subsection (b) above shall be reduced by any compensation that
       the Employee earns during the same period from any other source
       in connection with his personal services.  All of the insurance
       coverage contemplated by Subsection (c) above shall be dis-
       continued completely as of the date when the Employee returns to
       employment or self-employment, whether full- or part-time, with
       an entity that offers any group insurance coverage to its
       employees or independent contractors, regardless of whether such
       coverage is equivalent to the insurance coverage contemplated by
       Subsection (c) above.

                 (e)  CAUSE.  For all purposes under this Agreement,
       "Cause" shall mean:

                      (i)  A willful failure by the Employee to perform
            his duties, other than a failure resulting from the
            Employee's complete or partial incapacity due to physical or
            mental illness or impairment;

                     (ii)  A willful act by the Employee which consti-
            tutes misconduct or fraud and which is injurious to the
            Company or to URS Corporation;

                    (iii)  The Employee's conviction of, or plea of
            "guilty" or "no contest" to, a felony; or

                     (iv)  The Employee's willful disobedience of
            lawful orders and directives.

                 (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.  For all purposes under this
       Agreement, "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any
       of the following events after the date of this Agreement:

                      (i)  A change in control required to be reported
            pursuant to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A
            under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
            "Exchange Act");

                     (ii)  A change in the composition of the Board of
            Directors of URS Corporation (the "Board"), as a result of
            which fewer than two-thirds of the incumbent directors are
            directors who either (i) had been directors of URS Corpora-
            tion 24 months prior to such change or (ii) were elected, or
            nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative

                 discretionary basis by Richard C. Blum & Associates,
                 Inc., resulting from a payment in securities of

                 Corporation outstanding as of the date of this
                 Agreement, shall be disregarded.
