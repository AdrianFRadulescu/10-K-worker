                            ARTICLE III.  THE LOANS

         3.1  Disbursement of Loans.  (a)The Company shall give the Agent
notice of each requested Loan in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto
(with sufficient  executed copies for each Bank) not later than 11:00 a.m.
Detroit time (i) three Eurodollar Business Days prior to the date of such
requested Loan in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (ii) on the
date of such requested Loan in the case of a Floating Rate Loan, which
notice shall specify whether a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Floating Rate Loan








                           -10-

is requested and, in the case of each requested Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Interest Period to be initially applicable to such Loan.  The Agent shall
provide notice of such requested Loan to each Bank by 2:00 p.m. Detroit
time on the date such notice is received by the Agent.

              (b)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the proceeds of any such requested Loan shall be made available to the
Company by depositing the proceeds thereof, in immediately available funds,
in an account maintained and designated by the Company at the principal
office of the Agent, provided, that the proceeds of the initial Loan shall
be used to pay all amounts owing to the Banks pursuant the Prior Credit
Agreement and the promissory notes issued by the Company thereunder, at
which time the commitments of the Banks under the Prior Credit Agreement
shall be terminated.  Each Bank, on the date of any such requested Loan,
shall make its pro rata share of such Loan available in immediately
available funds at the principal office of the Agent for  disbursement to
the Company.  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Bank
prior to the date of any requested borrowing under this Section 3.1 that
such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's pro rata portion
of such borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
portion available to the Agent on the date of such borrowing in accordance
with this Section 3.1(b).  If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so
made such pro rata portion available to the Agent, the Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) make such amount available to the Company, and such
Bank and the Company severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to the Company by the Agent until the
date such amount is paid to the Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the
rate at which overnight borrowings are available to the Agent from other
banks in its regional federal funds market.  If such Bank shall pay to the
Agent such amount, the amount so paid shall constitute a Loan by such Bank
as a part of such borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.  The failure of
any Bank to make its pro rata portion of any such borrowing available to
the Agent shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to make
available its pro rata portion of such borrowing on the date of such
borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for failure of any other Bank
to make such pro rata portion available to the Agent on the date of any
such borrowing.  Acceptance by the Company of any Loan in an amount less
than the amount requested by the Company as a result of any Bank's failure
to make its pro rata portion of such borrowing available shall not
constitute a waiver of the Company's right against such Bank for any
damages resulting therefrom.

              (c)  All borrowings hereunder shall be evidenced by the
Notes, and all such borrowings shall be due and payable and bear interest
as provided in Article IV hereof.  Each Bank is hereby authorized by the
Company to note on the schedule attached to its Note or on its books and
records, the date, the amount of its pro rata share of and the type of each
Loan and the duration of the related Interest Period (if applicable), the
amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereon, and the other
information provided for on such schedule, which schedule shall constitute



                           -11-

prima facie evidence of the information so noted, provided that failure of
any Bank to make any such notation shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, all
accrued interest thereon and other amounts payable with respect thereto in
accordance with the terms of the Notes and this Agreement.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company may borrow, prepay
pursuant to Section 4.1 and reborrow Loans under this Section 3.1.

         3.2  Conditions for Disbursement of Initial Loan.  The obligation
of the Banks to make the initial Loan hereunder is subject to receipt by
each Bank of the following documents and satisfaction of the following
conditions, each in form and substance satisfactory to each Bank:

authority or official of the Company's state of incorporation listing all
charter documents of the Company on file in that office and certifying as

date by such authority or official and certified as true and correct as of
the Effective Date by a duly authorized officer of the Company;

              (b)  Copies of the by-laws of the Company, together with all
authorizing resolutions and evidence of other corporate action taken by the

contemplated hereby, each certified as true and correct as of the Effective
Date by a duly authorized officer of the Company;

              (c)  Certificates of incumbency of the Company containing,
and attesting to the genuineness of, the signatures of those officers

Agreement and the Notes and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, certified as true and correct as of the Effective Date
by a duly authorized officer of the Company;

              (d)  The Notes duly executed on behalf of the Company,
appropriately completed for each Bank and dated on or before the date of
such Loan;

              (e)  The favorable written opinion of Warner, Norcross &
Judd, counsel for the Company, with respect to each of the matters as any
of the Banks may reasonably request;

              (f)  Payment of the closing fee described in Section 2.6;
and

              (g)  Simultaneously with disbursement of the initial Loan
hereunder, payment in full of all principal of all promissory notes issued
pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement and all accrued interest thereon
through the Effective Date, together with payment in full of all other
indebtedness under the Prior Credit Agreement, including without limitation



                           -12-

Effective Date under the Prior Credit Agreement, and on the Effective Date
all commitments to lend under the Prior Credit Agreement shall terminate.

         3.3  Conditions for Disbursement of Each Loan.  The obligation of
the Banks to make any Loan (including the initial Loan) is subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

              (a)  The representations and warranties contained in Article
VI shall be true and correct on and as of the date such Loan is made as if
such representations and warranties were made on and as of such date; and

              (b)  No Event of Default, and no event or condition which
would become such an Event of Default with notice or lapse of time, or
both, shall exist or shall have occurred and be continuing on the date such
Loan is made.

The Company shall be deemed to have made a certification to the Banks at
the time of the making of each Loan to the effects set forth in clauses (a)
and (b) of this Section 3.3.

         3.4  Minimum Amounts.   Except for conversions and prepayments of
all Loans of a particular type and conversions or payments required
pursuant to Section 4.4 or Article V, each Eurodollar Rate Loan and each
conversion and prepayment thereof shall be in a minimum amount of
$4,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and each Floating
Rate Loan and each conversion and prepayment thereof shall be in a minimum

continue a Eurodollar Rate Loan of one type as a Eurodollar Rate Loan of
the then-existing type or may elect to convert a Eurodollar Rate Loan of
one type to a Loan of another type by giving notice thereof to the Agent
(with sufficient executed copies for each Bank) in substantially the form
of Exhibit C hereto not later than 11:00 a.m. Detroit time (a) three
Eurodollar Business Days prior to the date any such continuation of or
conversion to a Eurodollar Rate Loan is to be effective, and (b) on the
date such continuation or conversion is to be effective in all other cases,
provided that an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted on
the last day of the then-current Interest Period with respect to such Loan
and, provided further, if a continuation of a Loan as, or a conversion of a
Loan to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan is requested, such notice shall also
specify the Interest Period to be applicable thereto upon such continuation
or conversion.  The Agent shall provide notice of such election to each
Bank by 2:00 p.m. Detroit time on the date such notice is received by the
Agent.  If the Company shall fail timely to deliver such a notice with
respect to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Company shall be
deemed to have elected to convert such Loan to a Floating Rate Loan on the
last day of the then-current Interest Period with respect to such Loan.





                           -13-

         3.6  Discretion of the Banks as to Manner of Funding. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank
shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of
its portion of the Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood,
however that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations
hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and maintained
each Eurodollar Rate Loan during each related Interest Period through the
purchase of deposits in the relevant interbank market having a maturity
corresponding to such related Interest Period and bearing an interest rate
equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.


                 ARTICLE IV.  PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS

         4.1  Principal Payments.  Unless earlier payment is required

Company shall specify to the Agent that obligation of the Company hereunder
to which such payment is to be applied or, in the event that the Company
fails to so specify or if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Agent may apply such payments as it may determine in its
sole discretion.  On the day such payments are deemed received, the Agent
shall remit to the Banks their pro rata shares of such payments, in
immediately available funds, (a) in the case of payments of principal of
and interest on the Loans, determined with respect to each such Bank by the
ratio which the outstanding principal balance of its Note bears to the
outstanding principal amount of all Notes, and (b) in the case of fees paid
pursuant to Article II and other amounts payable hereunder, determined with
respect to each such Bank by the ratio which the Commitment of such Bank
bears to the Commitments of all the Banks.

         4.6  No Setoff or Deduction.  All payments of principal of and
interest on the Loans and other amounts payable by the Company hereunder
shall be made by the Company without setoff or counterclaim, and free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments, or
other charges of whatever nature, imposed by any governmental authority, or
by any department, agency or other political subdivision or taxing
authority.

         4.7  Payment on Non-Business Day; Payment Computations.  Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever any
installment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan outstanding hereunder
or any other amount due hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is
not a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any installment of principal,
interest shall be payable thereon at the rate per annum determined in
accordance with this Agreement during such extension.  Computations of
interest and other amounts due under this Agreement shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed,
including the first day but excluding the last day of the relevant period.

                 ARTICLE V. YIELD PROTECTION AND CONTINGENCIES

         5.1  Additional Costs.  In the event that the adoption after the
Effective Date of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether
domestic or foreign), or any interpretation or administration after the
Effective Date of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether
domestic or foreign) by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with
any request or directive of any such authority (whether or not having the
force of law), shall (a) affect the basis of taxation of payments to any
Bank of any amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement (other than
federal or state income taxes or taxes imposed on the overall net income of
the Bank or the Michigan Single Business Tax), or (b) shall impose, modify
or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
by any Bank, or (c) shall impose any penalty or other condition with
respect to this Agreement, the Notes or the Loans, and the result of any of
the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Bank of making or maintaining
any Eurodollar Rate Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum receivable by
such Bank thereon, then, provided the Bank has complied with the notice
provisions of this Section 5.1, the Company shall pay to such Bank, from
time to time upon request by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate the Bank for such increased cost to or reduced sum receivable by
the Bank to the extent such Bank is not expressly compensated therefor in
the computation of the interest rate applicable to such Loan.  Any Bank
seeking reimbursement shall give the Company written notice, in reasonable
detail, of the law, treaty, rule or regulation, or any interpretation or
administration thereof, which may give rise to the increased cost or
reduced sum receivable to the Bank and the reimbursement obligation of the
Company.  Such notice, together with a detailed statement as to the amount
of such increased cost or reduced sum receivable, prepared in good faith,
shall be given to the Company within 90 days after such Bank has actual
notice of such law, treaty, rule or regulation, or any applicable
interpretation or administration thereof, and the Company shall make
payment to such Bank of the amount due within 15 days after receipt by the
Company of such notice and statement.

         5.2  Limitation of Requests and Elections.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, upon receiving a
request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.1, or a request
for a continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan as a Eurodollar Rate Loan of
the then existing type pursuant to Section 3.5, or conversion of a Loan to
a Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.5, (a) in the case of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, deposits in Dollars for periods comparable to the
Interest Period elected by the Company are not available to any Bank in the
relevant inter-bank or secondary market, or (b) the Eurodollar Rate will
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of making or
maintaining the related Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, or (c) by
reason of national or international financial, political or economic
conditions or by reason of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect, or the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority


                           -16-

charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Bank with any request or directive of such authority (whether or not
having the force of law), including without limitation exchange controls,
it is impracticable, unlawful or impossible for any Bank (i) to make the
relevant Eurodollar Rate Loan or (ii) to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loan
as a Eurodollar Rate Loan of the then existing type or (iii) to convert a
Loan to such a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then the Company shall not be
entitled, so long as such circumstances continue, to request a Eurodollar
Rate Loan of the affected type pursuant to Section 3.1 or a continuation of
or conversion to a Eurodollar Rate Loan of the affected type pursuant to
Section 3.5.  In the event that such circumstances no longer exist, the
Banks shall again consider requests for Eurodollar Rate Loans of the
affected type pursuant to Section 3.1, and requests for continuations of
and conversions to Eurodollar Rate Loans of the affected type pursuant to
Section 3.5.

         5.3  Illegality and Impossibility.  In the event that any
applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign)
now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any
Bank, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive of such authority
(whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation
exchange controls, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank to
maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan under this Agreement, the Company shall
upon receipt of notice thereof from such Bank, repay in full to all of the
Banks the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan so
affected together with all accrued interest thereon to the date of payment
and all amounts due to the Banks, if any, under Section 5.5, (a) on the
last day of the then-current Interest Period applicable to such Loan if the
Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such day, or (b)
immediately if the Bank may not continue to maintain such Loan to such day.

         5.4  Additional Contingencies.  If by reason of the adoption
after the Effective Date of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation,
or any interpretation or administration after the Effective Date of any
applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation by any governmental authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Bank with any request or directive of such authority (whether or not
having the force of law), the ability of the Agent to establish the Prime
Rate shall be limited or restricted (other than by limitations or
restrictions affecting the charging of interest generally), the Agent shall
promptly provide notice thereof to the Company and the Banks.  Thereafter,
the Company, the Agent and the Banks shall negotiate with a view to
agreeing to a mutually acceptable alternative basis to make and maintain
Floating Rate Loans.  If an alternative basis is agreed upon within 30 days
after the date of such notice, it shall apply in accordance with the terms
of such agreement.  If such alternative basis is not agreed upon within
such 30-day period, the Company shall on the 31st day after such notice is
given repay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of each Floating
Rate Loan so affected together with accrued interest thereon (computed at
the rate applicable to such Floating Rate Loans immediately preceding the


                           -17-

imposition of such limitations or restrictions for the period after such
imposition) and, during the continuance of such circumstances, the Company
shall not be entitled to request Floating Rate Loans so affected pursuant
to Section 3.1 or continuations of or conversions to Floating Rate Loans so
affected pursuant to Section 3.5.

         5.5  Indemnification.  If the Company makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan on any other date than
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether pursuant to
Section 4.4, Section 5.3, Section 8.2 or otherwise), or if the Company
fails to borrow any Eurodollar Rate Loan after notice has been given in
accordance with Section 3.1 (except if such failure is due to circumstances
described in Section 5.2), or fails to make any payment of principal or
interest in respect of a Eurodollar Rate Loan when due, the Company shall
reimburse each Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by
each such Bank, including without limitation any loss incurred in
obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, provided
that (a) the Company shall not be required to reimburse any Bank under this
Section 5.5 for any such loss or expense not attributable to the relevant
Loan (i.e., the Loan with respect to which such nonconforming payment is
made, or the Loan that is not borrowed by the Company after such notice is
given, or the Loan with respect to which such due payment is not made)
being a Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (b) the Company shall have no liability
under this Section 5.5 with respect to any prepayment pursuant to Section
5.3 that is required due to the application of any law, treaty, rule or
regulation, any interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or
directive, as the case may be, in effect prior to the Effective Date.  A
detailed statement as to the amount of such loss or expense, prepared in
good faith and submitted by such Bank to the Company, shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount thereof.

         5.6  Capital Adequacy.  In the event that the adoption after the
Effective Date of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether
domestic or foreign), or any interpretation or administration after the
Effective Date of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation by any
governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank
with any request or directive of any such authority (whether or not having
force of law) regarding capital adequacy or a change therein, or compliance
by any Bank, any such controlling corporation  or any of their branches
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy of any such
authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
such Bank's or such controlling corporation's capital as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank or such
controlling corporation would have achieved but for any of the foregoing by
an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, the Company shall pay to such
Bank, from time to time upon request by such Bank, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Bank or such controlling corporation for such
reduction, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay such
compensation to any Bank or corporation controlling such Bank, as the case
may be, to the extent such reduction is attributable to any such law,
treaty, rule or regulation, or interpretation or administration thereof, or


                           -18-

request or directive, as the case may be, that is not generally applicable
to (a) in the case of each Bank that is a national bank, all national
banks, or (b) in the case of any of the Banks, all banks organized under
the same authority as such Bank (i.e., if such Bank is a State of Michigan
chartered bank, all State of Michigan chartered banks and if such Bank is a
federal savings bank, all federal savings banks, etc.) in any of the states
in which such Bank has an office.  Any Bank seeking reimbursement shall
give the Company written notice, and reasonable detail, of the law, treaty,
rule or regulation, or any interpretation or administration thereof, which
may give rise to the increased cost or reduce some receivable to the Bank
or such controlling corporation and the reimbursement obligation of the
Company.  Such notice, together with a detailed statement as to the amount
of such increased cost or reduce some receivable, prepared in good faith,
shall be given to the Company within ninety (90) days after such Bank has
actual notice of such law, treaty, rule or regulation, or any applicable
interpretation or administration thereof, and the Company shall make
payment to such Bank of the amount due within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Company of such notice and statement.

proceeds of any Loan will be used for the purpose, whether immediate,
incidental, or ultimate, of buying or carrying any such margin stock or
maintaining or extending credit to others for such purpose.

         6.8  Consents, Etc.  No consent, approval or authorization of or

or not incorporated) which together with the Company would be treated as a
single employer under Section 4001 of ERISA or (ii) for the appointment by
the appropriate United States District Court of a trustee to administer
such Plan and such reportable event is not corrected and such determination




                           -28-

is not revoked within 30 days after notice thereof has been given to the
administrator of such Plan or to the Company or such trade or business, as
the case may be; or the institution of proceedings by  the PBGC to
terminate any such Plan or to appoint a trustee to administer such Plan and
the failure of the Company to (i) appropriately, diligently and in good
faith successfully contest such proceedings within the applicable required
period therefor or (ii) to establish adequate financial reserves on its
books and records with respect thereto; or the appointment of a trustee by

to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief or protection of
debtors or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a
receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for any
substantial part of its property, and, if such proceeding is instituted
against the Company or such Material Subsidiary and is being contested by
the Company or such Material Subsidiary, as the case may be, in good faith
by appropriate proceedings, such proceedings shall remain undismissed or
unstayed for a period of 60 days; or the Company or such Material
Subsidiary shall take any action (corporate or other) to authorize or
further any of the actions described above in this subsection.

         8.2  Remedies.  (a) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent shall, upon being directed
to do so by the Majority Banks, by notice to the Company terminate the
Commitments or declare the outstanding principal of, and accrued interest
on, the Notes and all other amounts due under this Agreement to be
immediately due and payable, or both, whereupon the Commitments shall
terminate forthwith or all such amounts shall become immediately due and
payable, or both, as the case may be, provided that in the case of any
event or condition described in Section 8.1(i) with respect to the Company,
the Commitments shall automatically terminate forthwith and all such
amounts shall automatically become immediately due and payable without
notice; in each case without demand,  presentment, protest, diligence,
notice of dishonor or other formality, all of which are hereby expressly
waived.

              (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, the Agent may, and upon being directed to do so by the
Majority Banks shall, in addition to the remedies provided in Section
8.2(a), enforce its rights and those of the Banks either by suit in equity,
or by action at law, or by other appropriate proceedings, whether for the
specific performance (to the extent permitted by law) of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or in the Notes or in aid of the


                           -29-
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or the Notes, and may
enforce the payment of the Notes and any of its other rights available to
the Agent or the Banks at law or in equity.

              (c)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default hereunder and, except for the occurrence of any Event or
Default set forth in Section 8.1(i), a declaration of acceleration pursuant
to Section 8.2(a), each Bank may at any time and from time to time, without
notice to the Company (any requirement for such notice being expressly
waived by the Company)  set off and apply against any and all of the
obligations of the Company to the Banks and the Agent now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Company and any property of the Company from time to time in
possession of such Bank, irrespective of whether the Banks shall have made
any demand hereunder and although such obligations may be contingent and
unmatured.  The rights of the Banks under this Section 8.2(c) are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of setoff) which the Banks may have.


                      ARTICLE IX. THE AGENT AND THE BANKS

         9.1  Appointment of Agent.  NBD Bank, N.A. is hereby appointed
Agent for the Banks and accepts such appointment and agrees to act as such
upon the conditions herein set forth.  The Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and
shall not, by reason of this Agreement, have a fiduciary relationship with
any Bank.

         9.2  Scope of Agency.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers or agents shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted by any of them hereunder or under the Notes, except for its, his or
her own gross negligence or willful misconduct and except as provided in
Section 9.3; or be responsible for any recitals, warranties or
representations herein or in the Notes or for the execution or validity of
this Agreement or the Notes; or be required to make any inquiry concerning
the performance by the Company of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or the Notes.  In the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, the Agent shall be entitled to rely, without liability
therefor, upon any certificate or other document or other communication
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by
the proper officer or person and upon the advice of legal counsel (which
may be legal counsel for the Company), independent public accountants and
other experts concerning all matters pertaining to the agency.  The Company
agrees, upon demand, to pay or to reimburse the Agent for the payment of
all reasonable compensation of such counsel, accountants and other experts
and all other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent.  To the
extent that the Company shall fail to pay or to reimburse the Agent for the
payment of the same, each Bank shall reimburse the Agent pro rata in
accordance with the Commitments, and any such amount so paid shall be


                           -30-
immediately due and payable to the Banks by the Company.  The Banks agree
to indemnify the Agent ratably in accordance with the Commitments for any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that no Bank
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         9.3  Duties of Agent.  In carrying out the agency, the Agent
shall have only the duties and responsibilities expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in performing such duties and responsibilities the Agent
shall exercise the same degree of care as it would if the Loans were
entirely for its own account, but  the Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the occurrence of any Event of Default, or any event or
condition which with notice or lapse of time, or both, could become such an
Event of Default and need not take or continue any action with respect
thereto or toward the enforcement of this Agreement or the Notes, nor
prosecute or defend any suit with respect to this Agreement or the Notes,
unless directed to do so by the Majority Banks and unless indemnified to
its satisfaction against any loss, cost, liability or expense which it
might incur as a consequence of taking such action.  The Agent may employ
agents and attorneys and shall not be answerable for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys selected by it with reasonable
care.  The Agent in its capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not acting as the Agent hereunder.  Each Bank agrees that it
has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with its decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement.

         9.4  Resignation of Agent.  The Agent may resign as such at any
time upon 30 days' prior written notice to the Company and the Banks.  In
the event of any such resignation, the Majority Banks shall, by an
instrument in writing delivered to the Company and the Agent, appoint a
successor which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company.  If a
successor is not so appointed or does not accept such appointment at least
5 days before the Agent's resignation becomes effective, the Agent may
appoint a temporary successor to act until such appointment by the Majority
Banks is made and accepted.  Any successor to the Agent shall execute and
deliver to the Company and the Banks an instrument accepting such
appointment and thereupon such successor Agent, without further act, deed,
conveyance or transfer shall become vested with all of the properties,
rights, interests, powers, authorities and obligations of its predecessor
hereunder with like effect as if originally named as Agent hereunder.  Upon
request of such successor Agent, the Company and the Agent ceasing to act


                           -31-
shall execute and deliver such instruments of conveyance, assignment and
further assurance and do such other things as may reasonably be required
for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming in such successor Agent
all such properties, rights, interests, powers, authorities and
obligations.

         9.5  Pro Rata Sharing by Banks.  Each Bank agrees with every
other Bank that, in the event that it shall receive and retain any payment
on account of any Note in excess of its pro rata portion, according to the
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, of the payment due all of
the Banks, whether such payment be voluntary, involuntary or by operation
of law, by application of set-off of any indebtedness or otherwise, then
such Bank shall promptly purchase from the other Banks, without recourse,
for cash and at face value, ratably in accordance with the principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding, interests in the Notes of the other Banks in
such an amount that each Bank shall have received payment pro rata on
account of the Notes in accordance with the unpaid principal amount thereof
then owing to it; provided, that if any such purchase be made by any Bank
and if any such excess payment relating thereto or any part  thereof is
thereafter recovered from such Bank, appropriate adjustment in the related
purchase from the other Banks shall be made by rescission and restoration
of the purchase price as to the portion of such excess payment so
recovered.  It is further agreed that, to the extent there is then owing by
the Company to any Bank Indebtedness other than that evidenced by the
Notes, to which such Bank may apply any involuntary payments of
indebtedness by the Company, including those resulting from exercise of
rights of set-off or similar rights, such Bank shall apply all such
involuntary payments first to obligations of the Company to the Banks
hereunder and under the Notes and then to such other Indebtedness owed to
such Bank by the Company.


                           ARTICLE X.  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 Amendments; Etc.  This Agreement and any term or provision
hereof may be amended, waived or terminated by an instrument in writing
executed by the Company and the Majority Banks, provided that, except by an
instrument in writing executed by the Company and all of the Banks, no such
amendment, waiver or termination shall:

              (a)  Authorize or permit the extension of the time or times
of payment or prepayment of the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any of them, including without limitation amending the Termination Date, or
the increase or reduction in principal amount thereof or the reduction in
the rate of interest thereon, or the rate of any fees or compensating
balances or any other modification in the terms of the payment or
prepayment of the principal of or interest on the Notes; or

              (b)  Amend or change the respective amounts of the Banks'
Commitments set forth in Section 2.1, or reduce the percentage of the




                           -32-
aggregate principal amount of the Notes required by the provisions of this
Section for the taking of any action under this Section 10.1; or

              (c)  Permit the termination of the obligations of any Bank
hereunder, provided that upon any such termination, (i) the Company shall
have the option to select a bank to replace such terminating Bank and to
assume the rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder, provided that
such replacement bank is acceptable to each non-terminating Bank, and (ii)
in the event that such terminating Bank is not so replaced, each
non-terminating Bank shall be entitled, but shall not be obligated, to
increase its Commitment by an amount equal to that amount of the
terminating Bank's Commitment bearing the same ratio to such terminating
Bank's Commitment as such non-terminating Bank's Commitment bears to the
aggregate Commitment of all non-terminating Banks.  In the event that any
non-terminating Bank shall not elect to increase its Commitment as
specified in clause (ii), each Bank making such election shall be entitled,
but shall not be obligated, to further increase its Commitment by an amount
equal to that amount of each non-electing Bank's Commitment bearing the
same ratio to such non-electing Bank's Commitment as such electing Bank's
Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitment of all electing Banks.  The
procedure set forth in the preceding sentence shall be followed until the
entire Commitment of the terminating Bank is allocated or until no
non-terminating  Bank shall desire to further increase its Commitment.
 
         Any such amendment, waiver or termination shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

         10.2 Notices.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section
10.2(c), all notices, requests, consents and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be delivered or sent to the Company at 9341

notices set forth on the signature pages hereof, or to such other address
as may be designated by the Company, the Agent or any Bank by notice to the
other parties hereto.  All notices shall be deemed to have been given at
the time of actual delivery thereof to such address or, if sent by the
Agent or any Bank to the Company by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, to such address, on the date of mailing.

              (b)  Notices by the Company with respect to terminations or
reductions of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.2, requests for Loans
pursuant to Section 3.1, requests for continuations or conversions of Loans
pursuant to Section 3.5 and notices of prepayment pursuant to Section 4.3
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Company.

              (c)  Any notice to be given by the Company to the Banks
pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.5 or 4.3 and any notice to be given by the
Banks hereunder, may be given by telephone or by facsimile transmission and
must be immediately confirmed in writing in the manner provided in Section
10.2(a).  Any such notice given by telephone and facsimile transmission



                           -33-

shall be deemed effective upon receipt thereof by the party to whom such
notice is given.

         10.3 Conduct No Waiver;  Remedies Cumulative.  No course of
dealing on the part of the Agent or the Banks, nor any delay or failure on
the part of the Agent or the Banks in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right or privilege or
otherwise prejudice the Agent's or any Bank's rights and remedies
hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.  No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Banks
under this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to
every other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing
under any applicable law.  Every right and remedy given by this Agreement
or by applicable law to the Agent or the Banks may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by them.

         10.4 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions.  All terms,
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the Company made
herein or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto
shall be deemed to be material and to have been relied upon by each Bank,
notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by any Bank
or on any Bank's behalf, and those covenants and agreements of the Company
set forth in Article V and in Section 10.5 shall survive the repayment in
full of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments.

         10.5 Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay and save the Agent and
the Banks harmless from liability for the payment of (a) the reasonable
fees and expenses of Dickinson, Wright, Moon, Van Dusen & Freeman, counsel
for the Agent, in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Notes and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in connection with any amendments, waivers or
consents in connection therewith, and (b) all reasonable costs and expenses
of the Agent and the Banks (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with any Event of Default or the enforcement of this
Agreement or the Notes.

         10.6 Successors and Assigns.  (a) This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, provided that the Company may not, without the
prior consent of the Banks, assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
under the Notes and the Banks shall not be obligated to make any Loan
hereunder to any entity other than the Company.

              (b)  Any Bank may sell a participation interest to any
financial institution or institutions, and such financial institution or
institutions may further sell, a participation interest (undivided or
divided) in, the Loans and such Bank's rights and benefits under this
Agreement and the Notes, and to the extent of that participation, such




                           -34-
participant or participants shall have no rights or benefits against the
Company hereunder, provided, however, that (i) such Bank's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unmodified and fully effective and
enforceable against such Bank, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of its Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Company, the Agent and the other Banks
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection
with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (v) such
Bank shall not grant to its participant any rights to consent or withhold
consent to any action taken by such Bank or the Agent under this Agreement
other than action requiring the consent of all of the Banks hereunder.

              (c)  Each Bank may, with the prior consent of the Company
and the Agent (and not otherwise), assign to one or more banks or other
entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and
not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations, (ii) except in the
case of an assignment of all of a Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (A) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Bank being
assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no
event be less than $3,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
thereafter, or such lesser amount as the Company and the Agent may consent
to and (B) after giving effect to each such assignment, the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Bank when the Commitments are at their lower
amounts shall in no event be less than $3,000,000, and (iii) the parties to
each such assignment shall execute and  deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording, an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of
Exhibit D hereto (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), together with any Note
or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing fee of $5,000.  Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the
effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
hereunder and (y) the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a
party hereto).

              (d)  The Agent shall at all times maintain a minimum
Commitment of $3,000,000, unless such Commitment is terminated pursuant to
Section 2.2 or 8.2.

         10.7 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the


                           -35-
same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart, and this Agreement shall enter into force and
effect only if counterparts executed by the Company and by each Bank named
in Section 2.1(a) are returned to and executed by the Agent.  Upon such
execution by the Agent, this Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the
Effective Date.

         10.8 Governing Law.  This Agreement is a contract made under, and
the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan
applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such
State.

         10.9 Headings.  The headings of the various subdivisions hereof
are for the convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify any of
the terms or provisions hereof.

         10.10  Construction of Certain Provisions.  All computations
required hereunder and all financial terms used herein shall be made or
construed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
unless such principles are inconsistent with the express requirements of
this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement refers to any action to
be taken by any person, or which such person is prohibited from taking,
such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or
indirectly by such person, whether or not expressly specified in such
provision.

         10.11  Integration and Severability.  This Agreement embodies the
entire agreement and understanding among the Company, the Agent and the
Banks, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to
the subject matter hereof.  In case any one or more of the obligations of
the Company under this Agreement or the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining obligations of the Company shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby,  and such invalidity, illegality or
enforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality
or enforceability of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement or
the Notes in any other jurisdiction.

         10.12  Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding any provisions
of this Agreement or the Notes, in no event shall the amount of interest
paid or agreed to be paid by the Company exceed an amount computed at the
highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law.  If, from any
circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Agreement or
the Notes at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall
involve exceeding the interest rate limitation validly prescribed by law
which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then,
ipso facto, the obligations to be fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount
computed at the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law,
and if for any reason whatsoever the Banks shall ever receive as interest
an amount which would be deemed unlawful under such applicable law, such
interest shall be automatically applied to the payment of principal of the


                           -36-
Loans outstanding hereunder (whether or not then due and payable) and not
to the payment of interest, or shall be refunded to the Company if such
principal has been paid in full.

         10.13  Independence of Covenants.  All covenants contained herein
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or
condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would
be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitation of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exits.

         10.14  Waiver of Jury Trial.  The Banks and the Agent and the
Company, after consulting or having had the opportunity to consult with
counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive any right any of
them may have to a trial by jury in any litigation based upon or arising
out of this Agreement or any related instrument or agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any course of conduct,
dealing, statement (whether oral or written) or actions of any of them. 
Neither any Bank, the Agent, nor the Company shall seek to consolidate, by
counterclaim or otherwise, any such action in which a jury trial has been
waived with any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not
been waived.  These provisions shall not be deemed to have been modified in
any respect or relinquished by any party thereto except by a written
instrument executed by such party.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement
to be duly executed and delivered as of the 13th day of October, 1994,
which shall be the Effective Date of this Agreement, notwithstanding the
day and year first above written.

                           ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE



    Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
dated as of October ___, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), among WOLVERINE
WORLD WIDE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks named
therein (the "Banks") and NBD BANK, N.A., as agent for the Banks (the

same meaning.

    1.   The "Assignor" and the "Assignee" referred to on Schedule 1
agree as follows:

    2.   The Assignor hereby sells and assigns (without recourse) to
the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the
Assignor, an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under
the Credit Agreement as of the date hereof equal to the percentage interest
specified on Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and obligations under the
Credit Agreement.  After giving effect to such sale and assignment, the
Assignee's Commitments and the amounts of the Loans owing to the Assignee
will be as set forth on Schedule 1.

    3.   The Assignor (i) represents and warrants that it is the
legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder
and that such interest is free and clear of any adverse claim; (ii) makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to

the Credit Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Credit Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by
the Borrower of any of its obligations under the Credit Agreement or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (iv) attaches

such Note or Notes for a new Note or Notes payable to the order of the
Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitments assumed by the Assignee

retained by the Assignor under the Credit Agreement, respectively, as
specified on Schedule 1.

    4.   The Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the
Credit Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred
to therein and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) agrees that it will, independently and






without reliance upon the Agent, the Assignor or any other Bank and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under the Credit Agreement; (iii) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under the Credit Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; (iv) agrees that it will  perform in accordance with
their terms of all of the obligations that by the terms of the Credit
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank; and (v) if the
Assignee is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United
States, attaches the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of
the United States certifying as to the Assignee's status for purposes of
determining exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to
all payments to be made to the Assignee under the Credit Agreement and the
Notes or such other documents as are necessary to indicate that all such
payments are subject to such taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax
treaty.

    5.   Following the execution of this Assignment and Acceptance,
it will be delivered to the Agent for acceptance by the Agent.  The
effective date for this Assignment and Acceptance (the "Effective Date")
shall be the date of acceptance hereof by the Agent, unless otherwise
specified on Schedule 1.

extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender thereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall, to the
extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
and be released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement.  All
representations and agreements by the Assignor and the Assignee herein may
be relied upon by the Agent and the Banks under the Credit Agreement.

    7.   Upon such acceptance and recording by the Agent, from and
after the Effective Date, the Agent shall make all payments under the
Credit Agreement and the Notes in respect of the interest assigned hereby
(including, without limitation, all payments of principal, interest and
commitment fees with respect thereto) to the Assignee.  The Assignor and
Assignee shall make all appropriate adjustments in payments under the
Credit Agreement and the Notes for periods prior to the Effective Date
directly between themselves.

    8.   This Assignment and Acceptance shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan.

    9.   This Assignment and Acceptance may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Delivery




                                      -2-

Assignment and Acceptance to be executed by their officers thereunto duly
authorized as of the date described in Section 4 above.

                      SECOND AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT


          THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the "Second
Amendment") is made as of October 28, 1994, by and between WOLVERINE WORLD
WIDE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and NBD BANK, N.A., a
national banking corporation (the "Rights Agent").  This Second Amendment
amends the Rights Agreement dated as of May 7, 1987, as amended and
restated as of October 24, 1990, between the Company and the Rights Agent
(the "Rights Agreement").  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
Second Amendment have the meanings ascribed to them in the Rights
Agreement.


                                    RECITALS

          The Board of Directors of the Company wants to appoint Harris
Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Illinois ("Harris"), as successor Rights
Agent and transfer to Harris the duties of the Rights Agent under the
Rights Agreement.  To facilitate the transfer of the duties of the Rights
Agent to Harris, the Board of Directors of the Company determined to amend
Section 21 of the Rights Agreement to expand the eligibility requirements
for the rights agent to include Illinois trust institutions.


                   ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

     1.   Amendment of Section 21 of Rights Agreement.  Section 21 of the
Rights Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

     Section 21.  Change of Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent or any
     successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its
     duties under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in
     writing mailed to the Company, and to each transfer agent of the
     Common Stock and Preferred Stock, by registered or certified
     mail, and to the holders of the Rights Certificates by first-
     class mail.  The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any
     successor Rights Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing,
     mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case
     may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock and
     Preferred Stock, by registered or certified mail, and to the
     holders of the Rights Certificates by first-class mail.  If the
     Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become
     incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the
     Rights Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment
     within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such
     removal or after it has been notified in writing of such
     resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated
     Rights Agent or by the holder of a Rights Certificate (who shall,
     with such notice, submit his Rights Certificate for inspection by
     the Company), then any registered holder of any Rights

                                  -1-
     Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
     the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights
     Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall
     be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of
     the United States or of the State of New York, Michigan or
     Illinois (or of any other state of the United States so long as
     such corporation is authorized to do business as a banking
     institution in the State of New York, Michigan or Illinois), in
     good standing, having a principal office in the State of New
     York, Michigan or Illinois, which is authorized under such laws
     to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject to supervision
     or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the
     time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and
     surplus of at least $100,000,000.  After appointment, the
     successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers,
     rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally
     named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the
     predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the
     successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it
     hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance,
     conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later
     than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company
     shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights
     Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock and the
     Preferred Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the
     registered holders of the Rights Certificates.  Failure to give
     any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any
     defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the
     resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of
     the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.


                    SIGNED as of the date first written above.

President and Chief Executive Officer

May 2, 1994


Mr. George A. Andrews
8655 Wolven
Rockford, Michigan 49341


Dear George:

In order to confirm our earlier offer to you regarding your acceptance of
your new position as Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration
for the Global Operations Group effective February 28, 1994, I believe it
is helpful to set forth our agreement and list these terms in writing.  We
appreciate your past contributions at Wolverine and look forward to working
closely with you in your new position.

Wolverine will provide you the following compensation package in connection
with your new position.

-         Position.  Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration
          for the Global Operations Group reporting to Rick DeBlasio.  You
          have previously received a copy of this position description.

-         Salary.  Annual salary of $130,000.  You will be eligible for
          annual performance reviews based upon your performance in this
          position.

-         Car Allowance.  You would retain your present car allowance of
          $5,902 per year with this figure being frozen until it was in
          line with allowances for similar positions.

-         Stock Awards.  You would be eligible for annual stock awards
          beginning in 1994 subject to Compensation Committee approval of
          both Restricted Stock Grants and Incentive Stock Options.  These
          awards, when granted, would be similar to those offered other
          participants in the current "B" category.  Last year these awards
          averaged 500 Restricted Shares and 2,000 ISOs.

-         Bonus.

          a.   Annual Plan.  You will be a participant in the 1994 Annual
               Executive Plan at a 20% target payout.




Mr. George A. Andrews
May 2, 1994
Page 2

          b.   Three Year Plans.  You will be a participant in the 1994-
               1996 Three Year Plan at a target payout of 20% of your
               annual average compensation earned during those years.  You
               will retain your participation in both the 1992-1994 Plan
               and the 1993-1995 Plan at a 30% target payout with your 1994
               and 1995 compensation level being calculated at $171,000
               annually for purposes of these two Three Year Plans.

-         Deferred Compensation.  You will retain your current benefit in
          your Deferred Compensation Agreement.  If you are employed by the
          company until age 58 we will waive any early draw reductions,
          permitting you to begin to draw full benefit payments at the
          later of age 58 or your termination from the company.

-         Vacation.  We will pay you the difference between your current
          salary and your new salary for the eight weeks' vacation time you
          are currently owed.  You will earn future years vacation at your
          future salary.

-         Executive Life and Disability.  You will continue these benefits
          under similar terms to others in similar positions.

-         Pension.  You will be eligible for normal pension plan benefits
          due you from our qualified "Pension Plan" according to its terms
          and provisions.  Should you leave the company, for whatever
          reason other than for cause termination by the company in 1994,
          the company will provide, in addition to the above benefits, the
          difference between the Pension Plan calculation and the benefit
          that would have been calculated, based on your same years of
          service, had your 1994 compensation been comprised of your former
          $171,000 salary, in addition to your normally included current
          car allowance, and your 1993 annual bonus payment payable in
          March, 1994.  Should you leave the company, for whatever reason,
          other than termination for cause, in any time in 1995 through
          1997, the company will provide, in addition to your normally
          calculated pension benefit, the difference between the normally
          calculated pension benefit and the greater of the (i) benefit
          calculated, based on your then years of service, on your eligible
          compensation as defined in the then current Pension Plan, or (ii)
          $200,000.

-         Termination/Severance.  You understand and agree that the company
          may terminate you for any reason, with or without cause, at any
          time.  To the extent that your employment is unilaterally
          terminated by the company without cause prior to the end of





                           -2-

          release in form satisfactory to the company, the payments and
          benefits set forth below:

               for a period not to exceed the lesser of 24 months from the
               termination date or until you obtained a new position.

          (b)  Should your termination, as described above, occur on or
               after January 1, 1995 and on or before December 31, 1996,

               equal to the average annual salary and car allowance earned
               from January 1, 1993 to date of termination.  This
               compensation level would be paid to you for the lesser of

             STATEMENT RE COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE


          Earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Earnings per share
on a fully diluted basis are computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common equivalent
shares with a dilutive effect.  Common equivalent shares are shares which
may be issuable to employees upon exercise of outstanding stock options. 
Earnings and dividends per share are restated for all stock splits and
dividends paid.

          Shoreline Financial Corporation is not required to present
earnings per share on a fully diluted basis in the Consolidated Statements
of Income included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15.  That Opinion
provides that any reduction of less than 3% need not be considered as
dilution.
