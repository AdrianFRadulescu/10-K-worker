                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

         Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (the "Company"), designs,
manufactures, distributes and markets various brands and styles of
footwear.  The wide variety of footwear sold by the Company includes casual
shoes, slippers, moccasins, dress shoes, boots, uniform shoes and work
boots and shoes.  The Company is also the largest domestic tanner of
pigskin.  The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor of a 1969
reorganization of a Michigan corporation of the same name, originally
organized in 1906, which in turn was the successor of a business
established in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1883.

         The Company is a leading provider of branded, comfort footwear
for the entire family, supplying more than 17 million pairs annually to
consumers in 80 countries.  Footwear has accounted for 90% or more of the
consolidated revenues of the Company for each of the last three years.  For
further financial information regarding the Company, see the consolidated
financial statements of the Company, which are attached as Appendix A to 
this Form 10-K.  

         Footwear manufactured by the Company is sold under many 
recognizable brand names.  The Company's HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) brand 
is a world leader in affordable, comfortable, casual and functional
footwear for men, women and children.  The Company's WOLVERINE (Registered)
brand of work and sport boots ranks as the number two brand of work and 
sport boots.  The Company's BATES (Registered) brand is the number one
brand of uniform footwear in the United States.  The Tru-Stitch Footwear
Division is the foremost supplier of constructed slippers in the United
States.  The Company has also introduced a line of rugged outdoor and sport
footwear under the WOLVERINE WILDERNESS (Registered) brand. Through these,
and several other footwear brands, the Company expects to continue to
manufacture quality footwear for its customers.

         The Company also manufactures and sources shoes for sale through
world wide licensing arrangements under the COLEMAN (Registered),
CATERPILLAR (Registered) and CAT (Registered) trademarks.

         The Wolverine Leathers Division is one of the premier tanners of
quality pigskin leather for the shoe, automotive and leather goods
industries.  The pigskin leather tanned by the Company is used in a
significant portion of the footwear manufactured and sold by the Company,
and is also sold to other domestic and foreign manufacturers of shoes.

         The Company's products are sold by Company salespersons and
agents and through Company-owned stores.  Sales are made directly to
various retail sellers, including independent shoe stores, footwear chains
and department stores.  Most customers also sell shoes bought from
competing manufacturers.

         Company products are sold directly to more than 10,000 accounts,
operating more than 20,000 retail locations.  Sales are also made to large
footwear chains, including those owned or operated by other companies in
the shoe industry, catalog houses, and to the retail operations referenced
below.  

         In addition to its wholesale activities, the Company operated 124
domestic retail shoe stores, leased shoe departments and Company-owned HUSH
PUPPIES (Registered) Specialty Stores as of March 25, 1994. A fiscal 1990  
decision to downsize the factory outlet business will result in closing 
approximately 9 outlet retail locations during 1994.  Eleven outlet retail 
locations were closed in fiscal 1993.

         Of the 124 retail locations, approximately 66 are factory outlet
stores located in strip centers or in free-standing buildings.
Approximately 36 of these stores operate under the LITTLE RED SHOE HOUSE
(Service Mark) format.  These stores primarily handle closeouts and factory
rejects from the Company's own factories and those of other manufacturers. 

         Of the approximately 66 factory outlet stores, 30 are currently
operating under the HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) FACTORY DIRECT (Service Mark)
name in major manufacturer outlet malls.  These stores carry a large
selection of first quality company branded footwear.  The Company has and
may continue to selectively convert LITTLE RED SHOE HOUSE (Service Mark)
locations to this retail and merchandising format.  

         The 124 retail locations include 20 regional mall full service,
full price HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) Specialty Stores which feature
exclusively a broad selection of men's and women's HUSH PUPPIES
(Registered) brand footwear.  The Company also licenses independent
retailers who operate HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) Specialty Stores at
another 81 locations.

         In addition to retail shoe stores and HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) 
Specialty Stores, the Company operates 38 full price, full service family
leased shoe departments in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, which feature
the Company's wholesale brands.

         The Company derives royalty income from licensing the HUSH
PUPPIES (Registered), WOLVERINE (Registered), WILDERNESS (Registered) and
other trademarks to domestic and foreign licensees for use on footwear and
related products.  In addition, the Company sells its own pigskin leather
to certain of its licensees.  In fiscal 1993, the Company's foreign
licensees and distributors sold an estimated 8.3 million pairs of
footwear, an increase from approximately 7.4 million pairs sold in fiscal
1992.

         The Company continues to develop a global network of licensees to
market its footwear brands.  The licensees purchase goods from the Company
and third-party manufacturers and these purchases are generally supported
by letters of credit.  Each licensee is responsible for the marketing and
distribution of the Company's products, and generally purchases
substantially all marketing, advertising materials and products from the
Company.


                               -2-

         The Company operates a pigskin tannery as a part of its Wolverine
Leathers Division, from which the Company receives virtually all of its
pigskin requirements.  The tannery is one of the most modern pigskin 
tanneries in the world.  The quality pigskin leather utilized in the 
Company's products which incorporate this material is a significant element
of product cost, and is generally only available at comparable cost and
delivery terms from the Company's tannery.  Therefore, the continued
operation of this tannery is important to the Company's competitive
position in the footwear industry. In addition, the Company owns a minority
interest in Wan Hau Enterprise Co., Ltd. ("Wan Hau"), a principal tanner of
pigskin in Taiwan.  The Company provides semi-finished pigskin leather to
Wan Hau for finishing in Taiwan.

         The Company's principal required raw material is quality 
leather, which it purchases primarily from a select group of domestic
suppliers, including the Company's tannery.  The Company has traditionally
purchased the vast majority of the shearling used extensively in the
manufacture of constructed slippers and related products by its Tru-Stitch
Footwear Division from a single source, which has been a reliable and
consistent supplier.  The Company purchases all of its other raw materials,
including man-made materials and fabrics for uppers, and leather, rubber
and plastics for soles and heels, from a variety of sources, none of which
is believed by the Company to be a dominant supplier.

         The Company is the holder of many trademarks which identify its
products.  The trademarks which are most widely used by the Company include
HUSH PUPPIES (Registered), WOLVERINE (Registered), WILDERNESS (Registered),
WOLVERINE WILDERNESS (Registered), BATES (Registered), FLOATERS (Trademark),
BATES FLOATAWAYS (Registered), HARBOR TOWN (Trademark), TOWN & COUNTRY 
(Trademark), TRU-STITCH (Registered), WIMZEES (Registered), and SIOUX MOX 
(Registered).  The Company is also licensed to market footwear in the 
United States under the COLEMAN (Registered) trademark and throughout the
world under the CATERPILLAR (Registered) and CAT (Registered) trademarks.
Pigskin leather produced by the Company is sold under the trademarks
BREATHIN' BRUSHED PIGSKIN (Registered), SILKEE (Registered) and WEATHER
TIGHT (Registered).

         The Company believes that its products are identified by its
trademarks and thus its trademarks are a valuable asset.  It is the policy
of the Company to vigorously defend its trademarks against infringement to
the greatest extent practicable under the laws of the United States and
other countries.  The Company is also the holder of several patents,
copyrights and various other proprietary rights.  The Company protects all
of its proprietary rights to the greatest extent practicable under
applicable law.

         The Company does not have a significant backlog of non-cancelable
orders.  On March 1, 1994, the Company had a backlog of orders believed to
be firm of approximately $69 million compared with a backlog of




                               -3-

approximately $66 million on March 20, 1993.  Historically, the Company has
not experienced significant cancellation of orders.  While orders in
backlog are subject to cancellation by customers, the Company expects that
substantially all of these orders will be shipped in fiscal 1994.

         Retail footwear sales are seasonal with significant increases in
sales experienced during the Christmas, Easter and back-to-school periods. 
Due to this seasonal nature of footwear sales, the Company experiences some
fluctuation in the levels of working capital.  The Company provides working
capital for such fluctuation through internal financing and a revolving
credit agreement which the Company has in place.  The Company expects the
seasonal sales pattern to continue in future years.

         A broad distribution base insulates the Company from dependence
on any one customer.  No customer of the Company accounted for more than
10% of the Company's consolidated revenues in fiscal year 1993.  

         The Company's footwear lines are manufactured and marketed in a
highly competitive environment.  The Company competes with numerous other
manufacturers (domestic and foreign) and importers, many of which are
larger and have greater resources than the Company.  The Company's major
competitors for its brands of footwear are generally located in the United
States. The Company has at least six major competitors in connection with
the sale of its work shoes and boots, at least eight major competitors in
connection with the sale of its sport boots, and at least fifteen major
competitors in connection with the sale of its casual and dress shoes.
Virtually all domestic and foreign manufacturers of footwear compete, or
plan to compete, with the Company in the rugged casual and outdoor footwear
market.  Many of these competitors are established in the footwear
industry, and have strong market identities.

         Product performance and quality, including technological
improvements, product identity, competitive pricing, and the ability to
adapt to style changes are all important elements of competition in the
footwear markets served by the Company.  The Company attempts to meet
competition and maintain its competitive position through promotion of
brand awareness, manufacturing efficiencies, its tannery operations and the
style, comfort and value of its products.  Future sales of the Company will
be affected by its continued ability to sell its products at competitive
prices and to meet shifts in customer preference.

         Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company
is unable to state with certainty its position in the shoe industry,
however, the Company believes it is one of the ten largest domestic
manufacturers of footwear.

         Foreign footwear manufacturers and importers also provide a
source of competition for the Company.  In order to remain competitive with
these foreign entities, the Company continues to improve and expand its
manufacturing facilities in Michigan, the Caribbean basin and Mexico.  In
addition, the Company is continuing to pursue lower cost manufacturing
alternatives in the Far East and Latin America.

                               -4-

         Although a significant portion of the Company's product line is
purchased or sourced overseas, the majority of its products are produced
in the United States.  The Company's footwear is manufactured in several
domestic facilities and certain related foreign facilities, including
facilities located in Michigan, Arkansas, New York, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Canada.  The Company includes, as
an integral part of its domestic manufacturing operations, five factories
located in the Caribbean basin and Mexico that produce footwear uppers for
final assembly in the Company's domestic factories.

         The Company sources certain footwear from a variety of foreign
manufacturing facilities in the Far East, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Company also maintains a small office in Taiwan to facilitate the
sourcing and import of footwear from the Far East.

         The Company is subject to the normal risks of doing business abroad
due to its international operations, including the risks of expropriation, 
acts of war, political disturbances and similar events, and loss of most 
favored nations trading status.  With respect to its international sourcing
activities, management believes that over a period of time, it could arrange
adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from its 
foreign suppliers.  A sustained disruption of such sources of supply could, 
particularly on a short-term basis, have an adverse impact on the Company's
operations.  

         At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company 
announced its intent to dispose of its Brooks athletic footwear and sports 
apparel business.  The Brooks business consisted of sales and distribution 
operations in the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 
sourcing activities, primarily in the Far East, and worldwide licensing of 
the rights to the brand name.  The Brooks distributors in Europe were 
33%-owned equity investees from April 3, 1990 until July 1, 1991 when the 
remaining equity interests were acquired.

         During 1993, the Company sold the Brooks businesses in 
separate transactions in exchange for cash and notes totaling 
approximately $24 million.  Notes receivable of $7,700,000 were 
outstanding as of January 1, 1994, and are collateralized by substantially 
all of the assets sold.  Payments of $2,300,000, $4,324,000, and $361,000, 
representing the noncurrent portion of the notes receivable, are due in 
1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

         In addition to normal and recurring product development, design
and styling activities, the Company engages in research and development
related to new and improved materials for use in its footwear and other
products and in the development and adaptation of new production
techniques.  The Company's continuing relationship with the Biomechanics
Evaluation Laboratory at Michigan State University, which is funded in part
by a grant from the Company, has led to specific biomechanical design
concepts which have been incorporated in the Company's footwear.  The
Company also maintains a footwear design center in Italy to develop


                               -5-
contemporary styling for the Company and its international licensees. 
While the Company continues to be a leading developer of footwear
innovations, research and development costs do not represent a material
portion of operating expenses.

         Compliance with federal, state and local regulations with respect
to the environment has not had, nor is it expected to have, any material
effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the
Company.  The Company uses and generates, and in the past has used and
generated, certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be
deemed hazardous under certain federal, state and local regulations with
respect to the environment.  The Company from time to time works with
federal, state and local agencies to resolve cleanup issues at various
waste sites.  The Company recently received notice from the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources ("MDNR") that it is one of the 14 currently
named potentially responsible parties for cleanup of the Sunrise Landfill 
Site in Allegan County, Michigan.  The Sunrise Landfill Site is related to
another cleanup site in Allegan County, Michigan for which the MDNR has
identified 556 potentially responsible parties, including the Company.
The MDNR currently estimates that the total cost of cleanup of the Sunrise
Landfill Site is approximately $17 million, but actual costs could exceed 
this amount.  The Company is currently conducting an investigation into its
responsibility with respect to the Sunrise Landfill Site.  The Company 
currently anticipates that a substantial number of the 556 potentially
responsible parties for the related cleanup site in Allegan County, 
Michigan, will eventually be identified as potentially responsible parties
for the cleanup of the Sunrise Landfill Site.

         As of December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 5,088
domestic and foreign production, office and sales employees.  Approximately
1,218 employees are covered by seven union contracts expiring at various
dates through 1996.  The Company has experienced four isolated work
stoppages since 1975, none of which materially affected operations.  The
Company presently considers its employee relations to be good.


Item 2.  Properties.

         The principal executive, sales and administration offices of the
Company are located in Rockford, Michigan and consist of administration and
office buildings of approximately 123,300 square feet.  The Company also
has additional administrative and sales offices in Arkansas, New York,
Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada and Taiwan totaling approximately 32,400
square feet, the majority of which is leased.

         The Company owns and operates one pigskin tannery from which it
receives virtually all of its pigskin requirements.  The tannery is located
in Rockford, Michigan and encompasses approximately 160,000 square feet.

         The Company's footwear manufacturing operations are carried out
at 15 separate facilities, totaling approximately 713,500 square feet of
manufacturing space.  These facilities are located primarily in smaller

                               -6-

towns in Arkansas, Michigan, and New York and in Mexico, Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic and Canada.  Approximately 370,400 square feet of
manufacturing space is under lease at seven locations and the remaining
eight facilities are Company-owned.  The Company's current aggregate 
footwear manufacturing capacity is in excess of 12.0 million pairs of
shoes per year.  The Company believes its footwear manufacturing facilities
are generally among the most modern in the industry.

         The Company maintains twelve warehouses, located in four states
and Canada, containing approximately 804,100 square feet.  The vast
majority of these warehouses are Company-owned, with approximately 63,500
square feet at three locations under lease.

         In addition, the Company's retail operations are conducted
throughout the United States and as of March 25, 1994, consisted of
approximately 124 locations, including 38 leased shoe departments.  All
retail locations, except three factory outlet stores in Company-owned
facilities, are subject to operating leases.

         The Company believes that all properties and facilities of the
Company are suitable, adequate and fit for their intended purposes.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

         The Company is involved in litigation and various legal matters
arising in the normal course of business.  The Company is also involved in
several proceedings involving cleanup issues associated with various waste
disposal sites, as more fully described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  Having considered facts that have been ascertained and opinions
of counsel handling these matters, the Company does not believe the
ultimate resolution of such litigation will have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

         No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year covered by this report to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Operations

Results of Operations - 1993 Compared to 1992

     Net sales for fiscal 1993 were $333.1 million compared to $293.1
million for fiscal 1992. This 13.6% increase was driven by record sales in
the Wolverine Work & Outdoor Footwear Group, the Bates Uniform Footwear
Division and the Tru-Stitch Footwear Division. The Hush Puppies Company
also recorded a healthy sales increase during the year. These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in the Wolverine Leathers Division
sales.

     The Wolverine Work & Outdoor Footwear Group posted a sales increase of
33.8% which was the second year in which the sales gain exceeded 30%. The
continued success of Wolverine DURASHOCK (Registered) boots and the
introduction of WOLVERINE WILDERNESS (Registered) products to the market
place were the primary factors contributing to the sales gain. Increased
marketing efforts to promote the Wolverine Work Boot products also
contributed to the sales gains.

     A 16.2% increase in sales was realized by the Bates Uniform Footwear
Division. While the U.S. military continues to contract, the comfort
characteristics of BATES (Registered) footwear continues to gain acceptance
and the durability of the product makes Bates number one in this category.

     The Tru-Stitch Footwear Division reached record sales with a 20.7%
increase for the year.  Their prominent position in the market through all
distribution channels and the addition of B & B Shoe Company which produces
generally lower priced products continues to allow the Tru-Stitch Division
to grow its business. 

     While the Hush Puppies Company did not reach record sales volumes, it
did post an increase of 5.3%. The repositioning and revitalization of the
brand which began in 1992 is beginning to have a positive impact. Retail
and consumer acceptance for the product is apparent as the division's
reorder business for the year was strong.

     The Wolverine Leathers Division began resizing during the third
quarter of 1993.  The primary focus is to retract the business into high
margin areas where the business can perform profitability.  The volume was
reduced and this, combined with other actions, is expected to allow the
division to regain its profitability as it focuses on the higher value
added product in its offerings.

     Gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.0% from
30.2% in 1992.  The emphasis of value priced product in the market place
continues to place pressures on wholesale and retail price points.  The
Company is maximizing its pricing positions when superior products are
available, such as WOLVERINE (Registered) DURASHOCKS (Registered) and

                               -11-

TRU-STITCH (Registered) slippers, but is very cautious in raising prices
in order to increase gross margin levels.  A significant benefit, which
improved the Company's gross margin levels, is the manufacturing
efficiencies being produced in the domestic facilities.  This, combined
with the Company's low cost import operations, should continue to provide
the Company with product which can be priced attractively.

     Selling and administrative expenses for 1993 were 24.1% of net sales
compared to 26.0% of net sales in 1992.  While the expenses were reduced as
a percentage of net sales, the expenses increased $4.2 million.  The
increase was primarily a result of increased commissions due to higher
volume, the impact of intensified marketing and promotional campaigns, and
employee profit sharing programs.  The overhead reduction plan which was
announced in the fourth quarter of 1992 was successful and the initial
target of $3.0 million of savings was exceeded by over $1.0 million.

     Interest expense of $5.1 million for 1993 reflects a $1.4 million
increase over 1992.  However, 1992 interest expense did not include
interest expense of $2.3 million associated with discontinued operations. 
Overall, interest expense was reduced by $0.9 million as a result of the
reduction in debt levels.

     Other expenses in 1992 included a restructuring charge of $2.7 million
associated with the reduction in corporate staff and the write-down of
certain intangible assets.

     The 1993 effective tax rate of 27.9% compared to 28.7% in 1992.  The
decrease from the statutory federal rate of 35% was principally a result of
non-taxable earnings of Puerto Rican and foreign subsidiaries.

     Earnings from continuing operations of $11.5 million for fiscal 1993
reflect a 149% increase over fiscal 1992 earnings of $4.6 million.

     During 1992 the corporation incurred costs associated with the
operating losses of the Brooks Athletic Footwear Division and the loss
associated with the disposal of this operation, which totaled $14.8
million.  Additionally, the corporation elected to adopt SFAS No. 109
("Accounting for Income Taxes") and SFAS No. 106 ("Employers Accounting for
Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions") which resulted in a net
charge to earnings of $0.8 million.  There were no additional charges
associated with either the discontinued operations or accounting changes
for 1993.

     Net earnings of $11.5 million ($1.65 per share) for 1993 compares to a
loss of $10.9 million ($1.65 per share) for fiscal year end 1992.  The
change reflects the significant progress made in the core business units of
the Company and the improvements resulting from the divestiture of the
Brooks athletic business.

Results of Operations - 1992 Compared to 1991

     Net sales of continuing operations totaling $293.1 million for fiscal
1992 were $10.4 million, or 3.7% higher than 1991.  Sales gains were
                               -12-
realized in the Wolverine Work and Outdoor Footwear Group, the Bates
Uniform Footwear Division, the Tru-Stitch Footwear Division, and the
Wolverine Leather Division.  Partially offsetting these gains was a sales
decline in the Hush Puppies Company.

     The Wolverine Work and Outdoor Footwear Group posted sales gains of
38.0% over 1991, resulting primarily from the success of the WOLVERINE
(Registered) DURASHOCKS (Registered) boots which feature a rugged
adaptation of the patented BOUNCE (Registered) comfort sole.  Improved
styling coupled with an aggressive advertising campaign also contributed to
the product's success.

     A sales increase of 10.0% was realized by the Bates Uniform Footwear
Division despite a shrinking military market place.  The majority of the
growth in 1992 was attributable to the penetration of the newly introduced
HUSH PUPPIES (Registered) PROFESSIONALS (Trademark) line into the civilian
uniform market.

     The Tru-Stitch Footwear Division, the market leader of constructed
slippers, generated a 10.0% sales increase compared to 1991 as a result of
expanding its product offering to meet a broader range of retail price
points.

     During 1992, the Hush Puppies Company experienced a sales decline of
8.0% from 1991 primarily due to the continued weakness in the retail sector
caused by the worldwide recession.  The narrowing of the TOWN & COUNTRY
(Trademark) brand product offerings also contributed to the sales decrease.

     Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 1992 was 30.2%, a
decrease from 31.7% for 1991.  Margin declines were realized in the Hush
Puppies Company, due primarily to manufacturing volume reductions, and the
Tru-Stitch Footwear Division, resulting from an increase in sales of lower
margin merchandise.  Partially offsetting these declines were increases in
gross margins for the Wolverine Work and Outdoor Footwear Group and Bates
Uniform Division resulting from favorable manufacturing efficiencies and
improved pricing margins.  The liquidation of lower cost LIFO inventories
contributed .4% to the gross margin in 1991 and was not repeated in 1992.

     Selling and administrative expenses for 1992 of $76.2 million
increased by $1.3 million or 1.7% over 1991.  Increases in variable selling
costs were partially offset by expense reductions related to a corporate
overhead cost reduction program initiated in the fourth quarter of 1992.

     Interest expense of $3.6 million decreased by $0.1 million from 1991
as a result of a decline in interest rates partially offset by increased
borrowings.  Reported interest expense for 1992 does not include $2.3
million of interest which was classified as discontinued operations.

     Other expenses include restructuring costs in 1992 amounting to $2.7
million related to corporate staff reductions and asset write-offs compared
to a charge in 1991 of $7.5 million for litigation settlement and related
costs as described in Notes J and K to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
                               -13-
     The effective income tax rate for 1992 of 28.7% of earnings from
continuing operations is below the statutory rate of 34.0% primarily due to
nontaxable earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.

     Earnings from continuing operations of $4.6 million or $0.70 per share
in 1992 compared favorably to $4.4 million or $0.68 per share in 1991.

     The loss from discontinued operations in 1992 of $14.8 million is the
result of operating losses and the Company's disposition of its Brooks
athletic footwear and sports apparel businesses.  The disposition includes
the sales and distribution operations in the United States, France, Germany
and the United Kingdom and the worldwide distribution and licensing rights
to the brand name as described in Note C to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

     During 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes." The cumulative effect of adopting this change in accounting for
income taxes decreased the 1992 net loss by $0.8 million.

     The Company also adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 106 "Employers'
Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions" in 1992.  The
cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change increased the 1992 net
loss by $1.6 million.

     The net loss of $10.9 million or $1.65 per share compared unfavorably
to fiscal 1991 net earnings of $3.3 million or $0.50 per share due to the
cumulative effect of accounting changes and the loss from discontinued
operations recognized in fiscal 1992.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
     
     Earnings from continuing operations after adjusting for non-cash items
increased cash by $18.9 million in 1993 compared to $10.9 million in 1992. 
Of these amounts $12.9 million and $11.8 million were used to fund
increases in working capital.  The most significant changes in working
capital were increases in accounts receivables and inventories during 1993
which were required in order to fund the growth of the business.  In fiscal
1992, a significant reduction in other current liabilities was reported as
the litigation settlement was paid.

     Additions to property, plant and equipment of $6.6 million in 1993 was
higher than the $4.1 million reported in 1992, but relatively flat with the
$6.3 million in 1991.  The majority of this expenditure was related to
purchases of manufacturing equipment in order to continue to upgrade our
manufacturing facilities.

     In 1993, cash of $12.2 million was provided from the divestiture of
the Brooks athletic business.

     Payments on short-term debt of $15.2 million were made during 1993
which was principally a reduction of debt related to the discontinued
operations of Brooks.

                               -14-
     Long-term debt of $49.6 million in 1993 remains relatively flat
compared to $48.4 million in 1992.  While the senior notes were reduced by
$4.3 million, the Company recognized an increase in the revolving credit
obligations of $7.0 million. 

     The Company paid dividends of $1.1 million, or $.16 per share, which
was consistent with 1992 and 1991.  Additionally, shares issued under
employee stock plans provided cash of $2.2 million compared to $1.2 million
during 1992.  The Company expects to increase its dividend payout beginning
the second quarter of 1994 by 50%. 

     The Company continues to strengthen its financial position as the
current ratio improved to 3.9 : 1 in 1993 versus 2.8 : 1 in 1992. 
Additionally, total interest bearing debt to equity was .46 : 1 in 1993
compared to .65 : 1 at year end 1992.

     The Company's credit facilities and banking relationships combined
with cash flow from future operations are expected to be sufficient to meet
the cash requirements of the Company.  The revolving credit facility which
expires in 1995 will be renegotiated during 1994 to assure that proper
financing remains in place for the Company.  The Company is also evaluating
the refinancing of its senior notes to determine the benefits of lower
interest rates.  Additionally, the Company maintains short-term credit
facilities of $41.0 million of which $13.4 million were used at year end
1993.

Inflation

     Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company over the
past three years nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the
foreseeable future.  The Company continuously attempts to minimize the
effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                January 1, 1994


Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority owned subsidiaries.  Upon consolidation, all intercompany
accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated.  The investment in
a 35%-owned foreign affiliate is carried on the equity basis.

Fiscal Year End

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the
Saturday nearest the end of December.  Fiscal years presented herein
include the 52-week years ended January 1, 1994 and December 28, 1991, and
the 53-week year ended January 2, 1993. 

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized on the sale of Company products when the related
goods have been shipped and legal title has passed to the customer.

Cash Equivalents

All short-term investments with a maturity of less than three months when
purchased are considered cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated
statement of cash flows.  The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all manufacturing
inventories (see Note B).  Inventories of the Company's retail operations
are valued using the retail method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated on the basis of cost and include
expenditures for new facilities, major renewals and betterments.  Normal
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is based on the earnings or loss reported in
the financial statements.  A deferred income tax asset or liability is
determined by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to the
cumulative temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and
liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred
income tax expense (credit) is measured by the change in the deferred
income tax asset or liability during the year. 

Earnings Per Share

Primary earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average
shares of common stock outstanding during each year and, for fiscal 1993,
the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options. Stock options are not
included in the computation of earnings per share in prior years since they
were not materially dilutive.  Fully diluted earnings per share for fiscal
1993 also includes the effect of converting subordinated notes into common
stock.  Fully diluted earnings per share are not presented for prior years
since the effect of exercising stock options and converting subordinated
notes was not material.

Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments, as defined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 107, consist of cash and cash equivalents, notes
receivable and long-term debt.  The Company's estimate of the fair value of
these financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts at January 1,
1994, except for certain long-term debt arrangements as discussed in Note
E.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in 1992 and 1991 have been reclassified to conform with the
presentation used in 1993.

Note B - Inventories

Inventories in the amount of $47,686,000 at January 1, 1994 and $38,950,000
at January 2, 1993 have been valued using the LIFO method.  If the FIFO
method had been used, the amounts would have been $19,903,000 and
$20,082,000 higher than reported at January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993,
respectively.

Reductions in certain inventory quantities during 1991 resulted in the
liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at costs prevailing in prior


                               -8-
                  Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and Subsidiaries
             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


years that were lower than current costs.  The effect of these reductions
was to increase 1991 earnings from continuing operations before income
taxes by $1,080,000 and net earnings by $702,000 ($.11 per share).  There
were no similar liquidations of LIFO inventories in 1993 or 1992.


Note C - Discontinued Operations

At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1992, the Company announced its
intent to dispose of its Brooks athletic footwear and sports apparel
business.  The Brooks business consisted of sales and distribution
operations in the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom,
sourcing activities, primarily in the Far East, and worldwide licensing of
the rights to the brand name.  The Brooks distributors in Europe were 33%-
owned equity investees from April 3, 1990 until July 1, 1991 when the
remaining equity interests were acquired.

During 1993, the Company sold the Brooks businesses in separate
transactions in exchange for cash and notes totaling approximately $24
million.  Notes receivable of $7,700,000 were outstanding at January 1,
1994 and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets sold.  The
noncurrent portion of the notes receivable representing payments of
$2,300,000, $4,324,000, and $361,000, due in 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively, are included in other assets.

The results of these businesses, which are classified separately as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations, are summarized as follows:

The above results for 1992 are through the third quarter when the decision
was made to dispose of the Brooks business.  Operating results of
discontinued operations for 1992 and 1991 include allocations of overhead
and interest expense.  Overhead expense of $370,000 and $556,000,

expense of $2,268,000 and $1,442,000, respectively, was allocated based on
debt incurred to finance the discontinued operations since acquisition. 

The Company also made charges of $16,300,000 ($9,335,000 after income
taxes) during fiscal 1992 to provide for estimated losses on the disposal
of the Brooks businesses including anticipated operating losses from the
end of the third quarter to the expected dates of sale.


Note D - Notes Payable to Banks

Notes payable to banks at January 1, 1994 consist primarily of unsecured
short-term borrowings of the Company's Canadian subsidiary.  The notes bear
interest at Canadian prime (5.5% at January 1, 1994) plus 2%.  Notes
payable to banks in 1992 also included unsecured short-term borrowings of 
the Company's Brooks Europe subsidiaries which were substantially repaid 
in 1993 in connection with the disposal of the Brooks business.

The Company also has $41,000,000 of short-term borrowing and commercial
letter-of-credit facilities. There were no outstanding borrowings at the
end of fiscal 1993; however, outstanding letters-of-credit amounted to
approximately $13,400,000.

Note E - Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following obligations at the end of fiscal
1993 and 1992:

</TABLE>
The 10.4% senior notes to insurance companies were issued on September 1,
1988. The note agreement requires equal annual principal payments of
$4,286,000 on August 15, 1994 through 1998.

Note E - Long-Term Debt (continued)

The revolving credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to the lesser of
$50,000,000 or amounts determined in accordance with certain asset-based
debt limitation formulas.  The agreement also requires the outstanding
balance to be no more than $30,000,000 during the period December 1 through
May 31 each year.  Interest is payable at variable rates based on both
LIBOR and prime (6% at January 1, 1994).  The agreement expires on June 30,
1995, but can be renewed with the mutual consent of the Company and the
participating lenders.  As of January 1, 1994, the available unused credit
under the agreement was $5,000,000.  Maximum borrowings under the agreement
during 1993 and 1992 were $46,000,000 and $45,000,000, respectively.

The subordinated convertible notes are payable in two installments of
$1,250,000 each in 1995 and 1996 with interest payable semiannually at
6.5%.  The notes are subordinated to all insurance company and bank debt
and are convertible into common stock at a price of $12.50 per share at any
time prior to maturity.

The revolving credit and insurance company loan agreements contain
restrictive covenants which, among other things, require the Company to
maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of working capital and
tangible net worth.  The agreements also impose restrictions on the
occurrence of additional debt, sale and merger transactions, acquisition by
the Company of its common stock and the payment of dividends.  At January
1, 1994, retained earnings of $2,873,000 are available for dividends or
other restricted payments under the most restrictive of these provisions.

Principal maturities of long-term debt during the four years subsequent to
1994 are as follows: 1995--$30,705,000; 1996--$5,586,000; 1997--$4,336,000;
1998--$4,286,000.

The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt approximates fair market
value except for the 10.4% senior notes and the convertible notes.  The
fair market value of the senior notes is estimated to be $24,300,000.  This
was determined using discounted cash flow analysis and the Company's
incremental borrowing rate for similar financing arrangements.  The fair
market value of the subordinated convertible notes is $6,000,000 based on
the quoted market price of the Company's common stock at January 1, 1994.


Note F - Leases

The Company leases machinery, transportation equipment and certain
warehouse and retail store space under agreements which expire at various
dates through 2002.  At January 1, 1994, minimum rental payments due under
all noncancelable leases are as follows (thousands of dollars):

Note G - Capital Stock

The Company's authorized capital includes 2,000,000 shares of preferred
stock with a par value of $1 per share.  No preferred stock has been
issued; however, the Company has designated 880,000 shares of preferred
stock as Series A junior participating preferred stock for possible future
issuance under the Company's stock rights plan described below.  Each share
of Series A junior preferred stock will have 100 votes upon issuance and a
preferential quarterly dividend equal to the greater of $6.00 per share or
100 times the dividend declared on the Company's common stock.

The Company's stock rights plan is designed to protect stockholder
interests in the event the Company is confronted with coercive or unfair
takeover tactics.  Under its terms, each stockholder received one right for
each share of common stock owned.  The rights will trade separately from
common stock and will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of
certain triggering events, including a person, group or company acquiring
15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock, tendering for a 15%
or greater interest in the Company, or acquiring 10% or more of the
outstanding common stock and being determined by the Company's Board of
Directors to be an adverse person, as defined.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note G - Capital Stock (continued)

Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase one one-
hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock for
$40.  Alternatively, in the event the Company is a party to a merger or
other business combination, regardless of whether the Company is the
surviving corporation, rights holders, other than the party to the merger,
will be entitled to receive common stock of the surviving corporation worth
twice the exercise price of the rights.  The plan also provides for
protection against self-dealing transactions by a 15% stockholder or the
activities of an adverse person.  The Company may redeem the rights for
$.01 each at any time prior to fifteen days after a triggering event. 
Unless redeemed earlier, all rights will expire on May 8, 1997.

The Company has stock incentive plans under which options to purchase
shares of common stock may be granted to officers, other key employees and
nonemployee directors.  Under the plans, which were adopted in 1979, 1988
and 1993, options are exercisable in equal annual installments of 25% over
three years beginning on the date the options are granted.  All unexercised
options under the 1988 and 1993 plans are available for future grants upon
their cancellation.  The 1979 plan expired during 1989 and no additional
options are available for future grants under this plan.

A summary of the transactions under the plans follows:

Note G - Capital Stock (continued)

A provision in the 1993 stock incentive plan allows the Company to make
stock awards to officers and key employees as consideration for future
services.  The intent of this provision is to provide a continuation of the
provisions of the executive incentive stock purchase plan adopted in 1984
and expiring on December 31, 1994, which awarded rights to purchase shares
of the Company's common stock at a nominal price of $1.00 per share. 
Common stock acquired under the provisions of either plan is subject to
certain restrictions, including prohibition against any sale, transfer or
other disposition by the officer or employee, and a requirement to forfeit
the award upon termination of employment.  These restrictions lapse over a
three- to five-year period from the date of the award.  During 1993, 15,484
shares were issued under provisions of the current plan and 4,716 shares
were issued under the predecessor plan.  Rights to purchase 19,700 and
26,500 shares of common stock under the 1984 plan for $1.00 per share were
granted in 1992 and 1991, respectively, and rights to 2,913 and 3,375
shares were canceled in 1992 and 1991.  The maximum of 150,000 shares have
been granted under the 1984 plan.  Additional shares may be awarded under
the 1993 stock incentive plan.  Such awards will reduce the number of
shares effected above as available for grant under the stock option
provisions of the plan.

Note H - Retirement Plans

The Company has noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering a
majority of domestic employees.  The Company's principal defined benefit
pension plan provides benefits based on the employee's years of service and
final average earnings (as defined), while the other plans provide benefits
at a fixed rate per year of service.  The Company intends to annually
contribute amounts deemed necessary, if any, to maintain the plans on a
sound actuarial basis.

The Company also has individual deferred compensation agreements with
certain key employees which entitles them to receive payments from the
Company for a period of fifteen to eighteen years following retirement. 
Under the terms of the individual contracts, the employees are eligible for
reduced benefits upon early retirement generally at age 58.  Prior to 1992,
the Company's policy was to recognize the deferred compensation cost over
the expected employment period of the individual employees.

In addition, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit plan
that provides postretirement life insurance benefits to full-time employees
who have worked ten or more consecutive years and attained age 60 while
employed by the Company.  Prior to 1992, the Company's policy was to
recognize expense when claims were paid.

The Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note H - Retirement Plans (continued)

The Company also has a defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees which provides for Company contributions based on the Company's
earnings.  Contributions to the plan were $760,000 in 1993, $69,000 in 1992
and $267,000 in 1991.

The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" in 1992.  SFAS No. 106 requires the estimated cost of
life insurance benefits and deferred compensation contracts to be
recognized over the period of employment to the date that employees are
fully eligible to receive future benefits.

The cumulative prior year effect of adopting SFAS No. 106 was recorded in
fiscal 1992 and amounted to $2,400,000 ($1,550,000 after related deferred
income taxes).  If the revised accounting principle had been applied
retroactively, net earnings for fiscal 1991 would not have changed
significantly.

The following summarizes the status of the Company's pension assets and
related obligations:

The discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation levels used
in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligation were 7.5% and 4% in 1993 and 8.5% and 5% in 1992.  These
assumption changes increased the projected benefit obligation at September
30, 1993 by approximately $3,300,000.

At September 30, 1993, plan assets were invested in listed equity
securities (69%), fixed income funds (20%), guaranteed investment contracts
(6%) and short-term investments (5%).  Equity securities at September 30,
1993 include 200,200 shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value
of $5,756,000.

The following is a summary of the pension income recognized by the Company:

Note H - Retirement Plans (continued)

The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% in 1993 and 8.5% in 1992.  The
Company's expense for postretirement life insurance benefits was $70,000 in
1993 and $50,000 in 1992 and 1991.

Note I - Income Taxes

Effective the beginning of fiscal 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". The new standard requires that an asset and
liability approach be applied in accounting for income taxes and provides
revised criteria for the recognition of deferred tax assets. As permitted
under the new rules, prior years financial statements were not restated.
The cumulative prior year effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 was recorded in
fiscal 1992 and decreased the net loss by $800,000.

The provisions (credit) for income taxes consists of the following:

Note I - Income Taxes (continued)

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of the end of fiscal 1993 and 1992 are as follows:

The valuation allowance has been provided to recognize the uncertainty of
realizing a portion of the deferred tax assets which are dependent upon
future taxable income.

The Company has provided for substantially all taxes that would be payable
if accumulated earnings of its Puerto Rico subsidiary were distributed.
Similar taxes on the unremitted earnings of the Company's foreign
affiliates have not been provided because such earnings are considered
permanently invested. The additional taxes that would be payable if
unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates were distributed are not
significant.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note J - Restructuring

A restructuring charge of $2,700,000 in fiscal 1992 is included in other
expense - net.  The charge consisted principally of costs associated with a
reduction in the corporate staff and the write-off of certain intangible
and other assets.  After related income taxes, the charge reduced 1992
earnings from continuing operations and net earnings by $1,730,000 ($.26
per share).

Note K - Litigation

On March 2, 1992, the Company settled lawsuits which were filed in 1989 and
1990 by Southwest Hide Company and First Security Bank of Utah under an
agreement requiring the payment of cash and notes.  To provide for the
settlement, the Company recognized a charge of $7,500,000 in its 1991
financial statements which is included in other expenses - net.  After
related income taxes, the provision reduced 1991 earnings from continuing
operations and net earnings by $6,100,000 ($.93 per share). 

The Company is involved in various other legal actions arising in the
normal course of business.  After taking into consideration legal counsel's
evaluation of such actions, management is of the opinion that their outcome
will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Note L - Industry Information

The Company is principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of footwear,
primarily casual shoes, slippers, moccasins, dress shoes, boots, uniform
shoes and work shoes.  The Company is also the largest domestic tanner of
pigskin which is used in a significant portion of shoes manufactured and
sold by the Company, and is also sold to other domestic and foreign
manufacturers of shoes and other products and to the Company's foreign
trademark licensees.  Royalty income is derived from licensing its
trademarks to domestic and foreign licensees for use on non-footwear and
footwear products.  As part of its footwear business, the Company operates
a number of domestic retail shoe stores that sell Company-manufactured
products as well as footwear manufactured by unaffiliated companies. 
Foreign operations consist of factories in the Dominican Republic and
Mexico which produce shoe uppers for Company operations in the United
States and a 75%-owned subsidiary which manufactures and markets branded
footwear in Canada.  Export sales, foreign operations and related assets,
excluding the discontinued Brooks European operations (see Note C), are not
significant.

The Company markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
sector.  Although the Company closely monitors the credit worthiness of its
customers and adjusts its credit policies and limits as needed, a
substantial portion of its debtors' ability to discharge amounts owed is

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

dependent upon the retail economic environment.  The Company does not
believe that it is dependent upon any single customer, since none account
for more than 10% of consolidated net sales.

Note M - Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

The Company reports its quarterly results of operations on the basis of
12-week periods for each of the first three quarters and a 16-week period
for the fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 included 17
weeks.

The following tabulation presents the Company's unaudited quarterly results
of operations for fiscal 1993 and 1992.  Certain reclassifications have
been made to the amounts originally reported in the Company's quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q to conform with the presentation used in the annual
financial statements.

                         Report of Independent Auditors


The Board of Directors
Wolverine World Wide, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wolverine
World Wide, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 1, 1994 and January 2,
1993, and the related consolidated statements of stockholders' equity,
operations and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended January 1, 1994. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and subsidiaries at January 1, 1994
and January 2, 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
January 1, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements

                          WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.


                                  ARTICLE I

                                   OFFICES

     Section 1.  The corporation's principal office shall be in the City
of Rockford, County of Kent, State of Michigan.

     Section 2.  The corporation's principal office and place of business
 in Delaware shall be its registered office in Delaware as set forth in the
 Certificate of Incorporation.

      Section 3.  The corporation may also have offices at such other
places, both within and without the States of Michigan and Delaware as the
Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the
corporation may require.


                                  ARTICLE II

                           MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Section 1.  All meetings of the stockholders shall be held, except
as otherwise provided by statute or these By-Laws, at such time and place
as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Meetings of
stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware as shall
be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of
notice thereof.

     Section 2.  Annual meetings of the stockholders shall be held each
year at such time and on such business day in the month of April as may be
designated by the Board of Directors, or if no such designation is made, at
10:00 a.m. local time on the last Thursday in April, or if that day is a
legal holiday, then on the next succeeding business day at such time as
shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.  Annual meetings shall be
held to elect by a plurality vote successors to those members of the Board
of Directors whose terms expire at the meeting and to transact only such
other business as may be properly brought before the meeting in accordance
with these By-Laws.

     To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either
(a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given
by or at the direction of the Board, (b) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (c) otherwise properly
brought before the meeting by a stockholder.  In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely
notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be
timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received
at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than 50
days nor more than 75 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in
the event that less than 65 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the
date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the 15th day following the day on which such notice of the date
of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made,
whichever first occurs.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the
stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares
of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and
(iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.

     Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2 of Article II, provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 2 of Article II shall be deemed to preclude
discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the
annual meeting.

     The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2 of
Article II, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall
not be transacted.

     Section 3.  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the
Board of Directors, or by the Chief Executive Officer, or upon the written
request of stockholders holding in the aggregate at least forty (40)
percentum of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the corporation
entitled to vote on the business to be transacted at such meeting,
delivered to such officer.  Such stockholder request shall state the
purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.  The meetings shall be held on
a date fixed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, or



                                      -2-
in the case of a stockholder request, on a date determined by the
Secretary.  In the event the Secretary questions the propriety of any
meeting requested by stockholders, such request shall be submitted to the
Board of Directors at its next meeting, and the determination of the Board
as to such propriety shall be final.  No special meeting of stockholders
shall be called for the purpose of removing a director or directors, for
electing directors, or for amending the By-Laws of the corporation, such
matters to be considered only at the annual meeting of stockholder,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a special meeting of stockholders may be called for
the purpose of removing a director for cause, such term to be as defined
under Delaware law, provided further that such cause is set forth in the
request for meeting.

     Section 4.  Written notice of all meetings of stockholders, stating
the time, place and in the case of special meetings, the purpose or
purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote
thereat, at least ten (10) days before the date fixed for the meeting.

     Section 5.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of
and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at
least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held and which place shall be specified in the
notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where said
meeting is to be held, and the list shall be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present.

     Section 6.  The holders of a majority of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for
the transaction of business, except as otherwise provide by statute or by
the Certificate of Incorporation.  If, however, such quorum shall not be
present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the officer of
the corporation presiding as chairman of the meeting shall have the power
to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or
represented.  At such adjourned meetings at which a quorum shall be present
or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

     Section 7.  Except as otherwise set forth in Section 1(f) of Article
III hereunder, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes



                                      -3-
or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in
which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of
such question.

     Section 8.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
creating any class of stock, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the
stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share
of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.

     Section 9.  Meetings of stockholders generally shall follow accepted
rules of parliamentary procedure, subject to the following:

          (a)  The chairman of the meeting shall have absolute authority
     over matters of procedure, and there shall be no appeal from the
     ruling of the chairman.  If, in his absolute discretion, the chairman
     deems it advisable to dispense with the rules of parliamentary
     procedure as to any one meeting of stockholders or part thereof, he
     shall so state and shall clearly state the rules under which the
     meeting or appropriate part thereof shall be conducted.

          (b)  If disorder should arise which prevents the continuation
     of the legitimate business of the meeting, the chairman may quit the
     chair and announce the adjournment of the meeting; and upon his so
     doing, the meeting is immediately adjourned.

          (c)  The chairman may ask or require that anyone not a bona
     fide stockholder or proxy leave the meeting.

          (d) A resolution or motion shall be considered for vote only
     if proposed by a stockholder or a duly authorized proxy and 
     seconded by a stockholder or a duly authorized proxy other than the
     individual who proposed the resolution or motion.

     Section 10.  At or prior to any meeting of stockholders, the Board
of Directors, or, if the Board of Directors shall have taken no action with
respect thereto, the chairman of the meeting, may appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  In case any
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be
filled by appointment made by the person presiding at the meeting or
entitled to preside at the adjourned meeting.  Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his ability.

     Section 11.  The Secretary of the corporation shall furnish the
inspectors with a certificate setting forth the number of shares
outstanding and entitled to vote, the voting power of each, the number of
shares required to make a quorum and the number of shares required to be
voted on any issue presented to the meeting if more than a simple majority



                                      -4-

of the quorum present.  The inspectors shall determine the shares
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and
effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right
to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the
results and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with
fairness to all shareholders.  On request of the person presiding at the
meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall
make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by
them.  The inspectors shall execute a certificate of the results of the
election or vote found by them.  Any report or certificate made by them
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as
certified by them.  In their determination of the validity and effect of
proxies, the inspectors shall make such determination, to the extent
possible, so as not to disenfranchise any stockholder.

     Section 12.  The inspectors may employ agents or other persons to
assist in their duties.  The meetings of the inspectors shall be closed
to all persons except as may be requested by the inspectors, provided that
the inspectors shall permit a reasonable time after their initial
tabulations for the presentation and determination of challenges to the
validity and effect of proxies and ballots.  In the case of an election
contest, whenever the representative of one or more sides is present
during the course of the inspectors' duties, a representative of all
other sides shall be afforded the opportunity to attend.

     Section 13.  In the tabulation of votes cast by proxies, it shall
not be necessary for proxies to execute a ballot on matters, voting
instructions (including no vote) for which are contained on the form of
proxy itself, and in the absence of a ballot executed on such proxies, the
proxy itself will be deemed a written ballot and tabulated in accordance
with the directions contained thereon.

     Section 14.  The person presiding at a meeting of the stockholders
may close the polls after the request for submission of proxies and ballots,
upon the temporary adjournment of the meeting called to tabulate the
proxies and ballots, or within a reasonable time thereafter.  After the
polls are closed, no proxy, revocation of proxy or ballot shall be accepted
by or considered in the tabulation of proxies and ballots.

     Section 15.  In the event it becomes necessary to adjourn a meeting
of stockholders beyond the day of the scheduled meeting in order to
determine the results of any election or vote, said meeting may be
adjourned from time to time by the person presiding or entitled to preside,
with such meeting to be reconvened at the principal offices of the
corporation in Rockford, Michigan.  The only matter to be acted upon at
such reconvened meeting shall be the acceptance and filing of the report
from the inspectors of election.

                                 ARTICLE III

                                  DIRECTORS

     Section 1.  Directors of the corporation shall be elected,
replaced and removed as follows:

          (a)  Number and Qualification of Directors.  The number of
     directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be
     not less than five (5) persons.  Subject to the limit above specified,
     the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by
     resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that a vacancy in the
     Board of Directors need not be filled immediately, and until filled,
     such lesser number shall constitute the entire Board of Directors. 
     Except as otherwise provided in this Section, directors shall be
     elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, and each such
     director elected shall hold office until the annual meeting for the
     year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor
     is elected.  A director need not be a stockholder, a citizen of the
     United States or a resident of the State of Delaware.

         (b)  Classification.  The Board of Directors shall be divided
     into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall
     consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total
     number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  At
     the 1990 annual meeting of stockholders, Class I directors shall be
     elected for a one- year term, Class II directors for a two-year term
     and Class III directors for a three-year term. At each succeeding
     annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the class of
     directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold
     office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held
     in the third year following the year of their election. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more
     classes or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting
     separately as a class, to elect directors at an annual or special
     meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of
     vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed
     by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto,
     and such directors shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this
     Section 1(b) of ARTICLE III, and the number of such directors shall
     not be counted in determining the maximum number of directors
     permitted under Section 1(a) of ARTICLE III hereof, in each case
     unless expressly provided by the Certificate of Incorporation.

         (c)  Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.  Subject to
     the right of the holders of any series of preferred stock then
     outstanding, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors caused
     by resignation, removal, death, disqualification or other incapacity,
     and any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
     number of directors, shall be filled exclusively by a majority vote of



                                      -6-
     the directors then in office, whether or not a quorum and shall not be
     filled by the stockholders.  When the number of directors is changed,
     any newly created or eliminated directorship shall be so apportioned
     among the classes of directors as to make all classes as nearly equal
     in number as possible.  Each director chosen to fill a vacancy or a
     newly created directorship shall hold office for the term coinciding
     with the class of his or her directorship and until his successor
     shall be elected and qualify.  No decrease in the number of directors
     constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
     incumbent director.

          (d)  Removal.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any
     series of preferred stock then outstanding, any or all of the
     directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause.

          (e)  Resignation.  Any director may resign at any time and such
     resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Chief
     Executive Officer or the Secretary unless otherwise specified in the
     resignation.

          (f)  Amendment or Repeal.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of these By-Laws to the contrary, the provisions contained in this
     Section 1 shall not be amended, altered, modified or repealed, and no
     provision inconsistent with this Section 1 may be adopted, except upon
     either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-
     thirds of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote in
     elections of directors or (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of
     the whole Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of the holders
     of a majority of such outstanding stock present in person or
     represented by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

          (g)  Nomination of Directors.  Subject to the rights of
     holders of any classes or series of preferred stock then outstanding,
     only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
     procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors.  Nomination
     of persons for election to the Board of the corporation at an annual
     meeting may be made at the annual meeting of stockholders by or at
     the direction of the Board of Directors by any nominating committee
     or person appointed by the Board or by any stockholder of the
     corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the
     annual meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in
     this Section 1(g) of Article III.  Such nominations, other than those
     made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to
     timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be
     timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and
     received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
     less than 50 days nor more than 75 days; provided, however, that in
     the event that less than 65 days' notice or prior public disclosure
     of the date of an annual meeting is given or made to stockholders,
     notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later



                                      -7-
     than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which
     such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
     disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  Such stockholder's notice
     to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
     stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a
     Director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of
     the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person,
     (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation
     which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other
     information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed
     in solicitations for proxies for election of Directors pursuant to Rule
     14a under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as
     to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address
     of stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of capital
     stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the
     stockholder.  The corporation may require any proposed nominee to
     furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the
     corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
     serve as Director of the corporation.  No person shall be eligible for
     election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in
     accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

          The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
     determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made
     in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so
     determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective
     nomination shall be disregarded.

     Section 2.  The business of the corporation shall be managed by its
Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation
and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By- Laws directed or required to
be exercised or done by the stockholders.

                      MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Section 3.  The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold
meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Delaware.

     Section 4.  The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors
shall be held following the annual meeting of stockholders, and no notice
of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order
legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present.  In
the event such meeting is not held immediately following the annual meeting
of stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be
specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of
the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed
by all of the directors.




                                      -8-
     Section 5.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board.

     Section 6.  Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chief
Executive Officer or Secretary or by any two (2) directors on two (2) days'
notice to each director.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be
specified in the notice of such meeting.

     Section 7.  At all meetings of the Board a majority of the directors
(other than directors elected at that meeting) shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors
present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the
Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.  If a quorum
shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall
be present.

     Section 8.  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting, if a written consent thereto is signed by
all members of the Board or of such committee as the case may be, and such
written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or
committee.

     Section 9.  The Board of Directors or any committee designated by the
Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of such Board, or
committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can
hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this section
shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

                           COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS

     Section 10.  The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive Committee
whose membership shall consist of such  members of the Board of Directors
as it may deem advisable from time to time to serve during the pleasure of
the Board.  The Board  of Directors may also appoint directors to serve as
alternates for members of the committee in the absence or disability of
regular members.  The Board of Directors may fill any vacancies as they
occur.  The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise the powers of
the Board of Directors in the management of the business affairs and
property of the corporation during the intervals between meetings of the
Board of Directors, subject to law and to such limitations and control as
the Board of Directors may impose from time to time, except that the




                                      -9-
Executive Committee shall not, without the express authorization of the
Board of Directors:

          (a)  Alter or amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the
     By-Laws;

          (b)  Fill vacancies in the membership of the Board of Directors
     or the Executive Committee;

          (c)  Declare dividends;

          (d)  Authorize the issuance of stock.

     Section 11.  The Board of Directors may designate such other
committees as it may deem appropriate, and such committees shall exercise
the authority delegated to them.

     Section 12.  Each committee provided for above shall meet as often as
its business may require and may fix a day and time each week or at other
intervals for regular meetings, notice of which shall not be required. 
Whenever the day fixed for a meeting shall fall on a holiday, the meeting
shall be held on the business day following or on such other day as the
committee may determine. Special meetings of the committees may be called
by the chairman, and notice thereof may be given to the members by
telephone, telegram or letter.  A majority of its members shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of the business of any of the committees.  A
record of the proceedings of each committee shall be kept and presented to
the Board of Directors.

                          COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Section 13.  The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and a
stated salary as director.  No such payment shall preclude any director
from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.  Members of special or standing committees may be
allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

                  CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING

     Section 14.  In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than
ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Any stockholders of record
seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by
written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the

     2.17 "Tax Benefit Right" means any right granted to a Participant
          pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan.


                                   SECTION 3

                                 Administration

     3.1  Power and Authority.  The Committee shall administer the Plan,
shall have full power and authority to interpret the provisions of the
Plan, and shall have full power and authority to supervise the
administration of the Plan.  All determinations, interpretations, and
selections made by the Committee regarding the Plan shall be final and
conclusive.  The Committee shall hold its meetings at such times and places
as it deems advisable.  Action may be taken by a written instrument signed
by a majority of the members of the Committee, and any action so taken
shall be fully as effective as if it had been taken at a meeting duly
called and held.  The Committee shall make such rules and regulations for
the conduct of its business as it deems advisable.  The members of the
Committee shall not be paid any additional fees for their services.

     3.2  Grants or Awards to Participants.  In accordance with and subject
to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to
determine all provisions of Incentive Awards as the Committee may deem
necessary or desirable and as are consistent with the terms of the Plan,
including, without limitation, the following: (a) the persons who shall be
selected as Participants; (b) the nature and extent of the Incentive Awards
to be made to each Participant (including the number of shares of Common
Stock to be subject to each Incentive Award, any exercise price, the manner



                              -3-
in which an Incentive Award will vest or become exercisable, and the form
of payment for the Incentive Award); (c) the time or times when Incentive
Awards will be granted; (d) the duration of each Incentive Award; and (e)
the restrictions and other conditions to which payment or vesting of
Incentive Awards may be subject.

     3.3  Amendments or Modifications of Awards.  The Committee shall have
the authority to amend or modify the terms of any outstanding Incentive
Award in any manner, provided that the amended or modified terms are not
prohibited by the Plan as then in effect, including, without limitation,
the authority to: (a) modify the number of shares or other terms and
conditions of an Incentive Award; (b) extend the term of an Incentive
Award; (c) accelerate the exercisability or vesting or otherwise terminate
any restrictions relating to an Incentive Award; (d) accept the surrender
of any outstanding Incentive Award; or (e) to the extent not previously
exercised or vested, authorize the grant of new Incentive Awards in
substitution for surrendered Incentive Awards.

     3.4  Indemnification of Committee Members.  Each person who is or
shall have been a member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company from and against any cost, liability, or expense
imposed or incurred in connection with such person's or the Committee's
taking or failing to take any action under the Plan.  Each such person
shall be justified in relying on information furnished in connection with
the Plan's administration by any appropriate person or persons.


                                   SECTION 4

                           Shares Subject to the Plan

     4.1  Number of Shares.  Subject to adjustment as provided in
subsection 4.2 of the Plan, a maximum of 350,000 shares of Common Stock
shall be available for Incentive Awards under the Plan.  Such shares shall
be authorized and may be either unissued or treasury shares. 

     4.2  Adjustments.  If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
changes by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, or any other change
in the corporate structure or shares of the Company, the number and kind of
securities subject to and reserved under the Plan, together with applicable
exercise prices, shall be appropriately adjusted.  No fractional shares
shall be issued pursuant to the Plan, and any fractional shares resulting
from adjustments shall be eliminated from the respective Incentive Awards,
with an appropriate cash adjustment for the value of any Incentive Awards
eliminated.  If an Incentive Award is cancelled, surrendered, modified,
exchanged for a substitute Incentive Award, or expires or terminates during
the term of the Plan but prior to the exercise or vesting of the Incentive
Award in full, the shares subject to but not delivered under such Incentive
Award shall be available for other Incentive Awards.  



                              -4-

                                   SECTION 5

                                 Stock Options

     5.1  Grant.  A Participant may be granted one or more Stock Options
under the Plan. Stock Options shall be subject to such terms and
conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  In addition, the
Committee may vary, among Participants and among Stock Options granted to
the same Participant, any and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock
Options granted under the Plan.  The Committee shall have complete
discretion in determining the number of Stock Options granted to each
Participant.  The Committee may designate whether or not a Stock Option is
to be considered an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422(b) of
the Code.  

     5.2  Stock Option Agreements.  Stock Options shall be evidenced by
Stock Option agreements containing such terms and conditions, consistent
with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall from time to time
determine.  Unless a Stock Option agreement provides otherwise, Stock
Options shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 5.

     5.3  Stock Option Price.  The per share Stock Option price shall be
determined by the Committee, but shall be a price that is equal to or
higher than the par value of the Company's Common Stock; provided, however,
that the per share Stock Option price for any shares designated as
incentive stock options shall be equal to or greater than one hundred
percent (100%) of the Market Value on the date of grant.

     5.4  Medium and Time of Payment.  The exercise price for each share
purchased pursuant to a Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be
payable in cash or, if the Committee consents, in shares of Common Stock
(including Common Stock to be received upon a simultaneous exercise) or
other consideration substantially equivalent to cash.  The time and terms
of payment may be amended with the consent of a Participant before or after
exercise of a Stock Option, but such amendment shall not reduce the Stock
Option price.  The Committee may from time to time authorize payment of all
or a portion of the Stock Option price in the form of a promissory note or
installments according to such terms as the Committee may approve.  The
Board may restrict or suspend the power of the Committee to permit such
loans and may require that adequate security be provided.

     5.5  Stock Options Granted to Ten Percent Stockholders.  No Stock
Option granted to any Participant who at the time of such grant owns,
together with stock attributed to such Participant under Section 424(d) of
the Code, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be
designated as an incentive stock option, unless such Stock Option provides
an exercise price equal to at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the



                              -5-
Market Value of the Common Stock and the exercise of the Stock Option after
the expiration of five years from the date of grant of the Stock Option is
prohibited by its terms.

     5.6  Limits on Exercisability.  Stock Options shall be exercisable for
such periods as may be fixed by the Committee, not to exceed 10 years from
the date of grant.  At the time of the exercise of a Stock Option, the
holder of the Stock Option, if requested by the Committee, must represent
to the Company that the shares are being acquired for investment and not
with a view to the distribution thereof.  The Committee may in its
discretion require a Participant to continue the Participant's service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries for a certain length of time prior to a
Stock Option becoming exercisable and may eliminate such delayed vesting
provisions.  No Stock Option issued to officers and employees subject to
Section 16 of the Act shall be exercisable during the first six months of
its term.

     5.7  Restrictions on Transferability.  

          (a)  General.  Unless the Committee otherwise consents or
     unless the Stock Option agreement or grant provide otherwise:
     (i) no Stock Options granted under the Plan may be sold,
     exchanged, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated
     or hypothecated except by will or the laws of descent and
     distribution; and (ii) all Stock Options granted to a Participant
     shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by
     such Participant, his guardian, or legal representative.

          (b)  Other Restrictions.  The Committee may impose other
     restrictions on any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to
     the exercise of a Stock Option under the Plan as the Committee
     deems advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions
     under applicable federal or state securities laws.

     5.8  Termination of Employment or Officer Status.  

          (a)  General.  If a Participant ceases to be employed by or
     an officer of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries for any
     reason other than the Participant's death, disability,
     Retirement, or termination for cause, the Participant may
     exercise his Stock Options only for a period of three months
     after such termination of employment or officer status, but only
     to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise the Stock
     Options on the date of termination, unless the Committee
     otherwise consents or the terms of the Stock Option agreement or
     grant provide otherwise.  For purposes of the Plan, the following
     shall not be deemed a termination of employment or officer
     status: (i) a transfer of an employee from the Company to any
     Subsidiary; (ii) a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing
     by the Company, for military service or for any other purpose
     approved by the Company if the period of such leave does not


                              -6-
    exceed 90 days; (iii) a leave of absence in excess of 90 days,
     duly authorized in writing by the Company, provided that the
     employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed either by statute
     or contract; or (iv) a termination of employment with continued
     service as an officer.

          (b)  Death.  If a Participant dies either while an employee
     or officer of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or after the
     termination of employment other than for cause but during the
     time when the Participant could have exercised a Stock Option
     under the Plan, the Stock Option issued to such Participant shall
     be exercisable by the personal representative of such Participant
     or other successor to the interest of the Participant for one
     year after the Participant's death, but only to the extent that
     the Participant was entitled to exercise the Stock Option on the
     date of death or termination of employment, whichever first
     occurred, unless the Committee otherwise consents or the terms of
     the Stock Option agreement or grant provide otherwise. 

          (c)  Disability.  If a Participant ceases to be an employee
     or officer of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries due to the
     Participant's disability, the Participant may exercise a Stock
     Option for a period of one year following such termination of
     employment, but only to the extent that the Participant was
     entitled to exercise the Stock Option on the date of such event,
     unless the Committee otherwise consents or the terms of the Stock
     Option agreement or grant provide otherwise.

          (d)  Participant Retirement.  If a Participant Retires as an
     employee or officer of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
     any Stock Option granted under the Plan may be exercised during
     the remaining term of the Stock Option, unless the terms of the
     Stock Option agreement or grant provide otherwise.

          (e)  Termination for Cause.  If a Participant is terminated
     for cause, the Participant shall have no further right to
     exercise any Stock Option previously granted.  


                                   SECTION 6

                                Restricted Stock

     6.1  Grant.  A Participant may be granted Restricted Stock under the
Plan.  Restricted Stock shall be subject to such terms and conditions,
consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined by
the Committee in its sole discretion.  The Committee may impose such
restrictions or conditions, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, to
the vesting of Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate.  




                              -7-
     6.2  Restricted Stock Agreements.  Awards of Restricted Stock shall be
evidenced by Restricted Stock agreements containing such terms and
conditions, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee
shall from time to time determine.  Unless a Restricted Stock agreement
provides otherwise, Restricted Stock Awards shall be subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Section 6.

     6.3  Termination of Employment or Officer Status.

          (a)  General.  In the event of termination of employment or
     officer status during the Restricted Period for any reason other
     than death, disability, Retirement, or termination for cause,
     then any shares of Restricted Stock still subject to restrictions
     at the date of such termination shall automatically be forfeited
     and returned to the Company; provided, however, that in the event
     of a voluntary or involuntary termination of the employment or
     officer status of a Participant by the Company, the Committee
     may, in its sole discretion, waive the automatic forfeiture of
     any or all such shares of Restricted Stock and/or may add such
     new restrictions to such shares of Restricted Stock as it deems
     appropriate.  For purposes of the Plan, the following shall not
     be deemed a termination of employment or officer status: (i) a
     transfer of an employee from the Company to any Subsidiary; (ii)
     a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing by the Company,
     for military service or for any other purpose approved by the
     Company if the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days;
     (iii) a leave of absence in excess of 90 days, duly authorized in
     writing by the Company, provided that the employee's right to
     reemployment is guaranteed either by statute or contract; and
     (iv) a termination of employment with continued service as an
     officer.

          (b)  Death, Retirement, or Disability.  Unless the Committee
     otherwise consents or unless the terms of the Restricted Stock
     agreement or grant provide otherwise, in the event a Participant
     terminates his employment with the Company because of death,
     disability, or Retirement during the Restricted Period, the
     restrictions applicable to the shares of Restricted Stock shall
     terminate automatically with respect to that number of shares
     (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to the total number
     of shares of Restricted Stock granted to such Participant
     multiplied by the number of full months that have elapsed since
     the date of grant divided by the maximum number of full months of
     the Restricted Period.  All remaining shares shall be forfeited
     and returned to the Company; provided, however, that the
     Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the restrictions
     remaining on any or all such remaining shares of Restricted Stock
     either before or after the death, disability, or Retirement of
     the Participant.




                              -8-
          (c)  Termination for Cause.  If a Participant's employment
     is terminated for cause, the Participant shall have no further
     right to exercise or receive any Restricted Stock, and all
     Restricted Stock still subject to restrictions at the date of
     such termination shall automatically be forfeited and returned to
     the Company.

     6.4  Restrictions on Transferability.

          (a)  General.  Unless the Committee otherwise consents or
     unless the terms of the Restricted Stock agreement or grant
     provide otherwise:  (i) shares of Restricted Stock shall not be
     sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise
     alienated or hypothecated during the Restricted Period except by
     will or the laws of descent and distribution; and (ii) all rights
     with respect to Restricted Stock granted to a Participant under
     the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime
     only by such Participant, his guardian, or legal representative.

          (b)  Other Restrictions.  The Committee may impose other
     restrictions on any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to
     an award of Restricted Stock under the Plan as the Committee
     deems advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions
     under applicable federal or state securities laws.

     6.5  Legending of Restricted Stock.  Any certificates evidencing
shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall bear the
following legend:

          The shares represented by this certificate were issued
     subject to certain restrictions under the Wolverine World Wide,
     Inc. 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  A copy of the Plan
     is on file in the office of the Secretary of the Company.  This
     certificate is held subject to the terms and conditions contained
     in a restricted stock agreement that includes a prohibition
     against the sale or transfer of the stock represented by this
     certificate except in compliance with that agreement, and that
     provides for forfeiture upon certain events.

     6.6  Representations and Warranties.  A Participant who is awarded
Restricted Stock shall represent and warrant that the Participant is
acquiring the Restricted Stock for the Participant's own account and
investment and without any intention to resell or redistribute the
Restricted Stock.  The Participant shall agree not to resell or distribute
such Restricted Stock after the Restricted Period except upon such
conditions as the Company may reasonably specify to ensure compliance with
federal and state securities laws.  

     6.7  Rights as a Stockholder.  A Participant shall have all voting,
dividend, liquidation, and other rights with respect to Restricted Stock



                              -9-
held of record by such Participant as if the Participant held unrestricted
Common Stock; provided, however, that the unvested portion of any award of
Restricted Stock shall be subject to any restrictions on transferability or
risks of forfeiture imposed pursuant to subsections 6.1 and 6.4 of the
Plan.  Unless the Committee otherwise determines or unless the terms of the
Restricted Stock agreement or grant provide otherwise, any noncash
dividends or distributions paid with respect to shares of unvested
Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the shares to
which such dividends or distributions relate.


                                   SECTION 7

                                  Stock Awards

     7.1  Grant.    A Participant may be granted one or more Stock Awards
under the Plan in lieu of, or as payment for, the rights of a Participant
under any other compensation plan, policy, or program of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.  Stock Awards shall be subject to such terms and conditions,
consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be determined by
the Committee in its sole discretion.  

     7.2  Rights as a Stockholder.  A Participant shall have all voting,
dividend, liquidation, and other rights with respect to shares of Common
Stock issued to the Participant as a Stock Award under this Section 7 upon
the Participant becoming the holder of record of the Common Stock granted
pursuant to such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Committee may
impose such restrictions on the assignment or transfer of Common Stock
awarded pursuant to a Stock Award as it deems appropriate.


                                   SECTION 8

                               Tax Benefit Rights

     8.1  Grant.  A Participant may be granted Tax Benefit Rights under the
Plan to encourage a Participant to exercise Stock Options and provide
certain tax benefits to the Company.  A Tax Benefit Right entitles a
Participant to receive from the Company or a Subsidiary a cash payment not
to exceed the amount calculated by multiplying the ordinary income, if any,
realized by the Participant for federal tax purposes as a result of the
exercise of a nonqualified stock option, or the disqualifying disposition
of shares acquired under an incentive stock option, by the maximum federal
income tax rate (including any surtax or similar charge or assessment) for
corporations, plus the applicable state and local tax imposed on the
exercise of the Stock Option or the disqualifying disposition.

     8.2  Restrictions.  A Tax Benefit Right may be granted only with
respect to a stock option issued and outstanding or to be issued under the
Plan or any other plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries that has been



                              -10-
approved by the stockholders as of the date of the Plan and may be granted
concurrently with or after the grant of the stock option.  Such rights with
respect to outstanding stock options shall be issued only with the consent
of the Participant if the effect would be to disqualify an incentive stock
option, change the date of grant or the exercise price, or otherwise impair
the Participant's existing stock options.  A stock option to which a Tax
Benefit Right has been attached shall not be exercisable by an officer or
employee subject to Section 16 of the Act for a period of six months from
the date of the grant of the Tax Benefit Right.  

     8.3  Terms and Conditions.  The Committee shall determine the terms
and conditions of any Tax Benefit Rights granted and the Participants to
whom such rights will be granted with respect to stock options under the
Plan or any other plan of the Company.  The Committee may amend, cancel,
limit the term of, or limit the amount payable under a Tax Benefit Right at
any time prior to the exercise of the related stock option, unless
otherwise provided under the terms of the Tax Benefit Right.  The net
amount of a Tax Benefit Right, subject to withholding, may be used to pay a
portion of the stock option price, unless otherwise provided by the
Committee.


                                   SECTION 9

                               Change in Control

     9.1  Acceleration of Vesting.  If a Change in Control of the Company
shall occur, then, unless the Committee or the Board otherwise determines
with respect to one or more Incentive Awards, without action by the
Committee or the Board (a) all outstanding Stock Options shall become
immediately exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable during the
remaining term thereof, regardless of whether the Participants to whom such
Stock Options have been granted remain in the employ or service of the
Company or any Subsidiary; and (b) all other outstanding Incentive Awards
shall become immediately fully vested and nonforfeitable.

     9.2  Cash Payment for Stock Options.    If a Change in Control of the
Company shall occur, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, and
without the consent of any Participant affected thereby, may determine that
some or all Participants holding outstanding Stock Options shall receive,
with respect to some or all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such
Stock Options, as of the effective date of any such Change in Control of
the Company, cash in an amount equal to the greater of the excess of (a)
the highest sales price of the shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date immediately prior to the effective date of such Change in Control of
the Company or (b) the highest price per share actually paid in connection
with any Change in Control of the Company over the exercise price per share
of such Stock Options.





                              -11-
     9.3  Limitation on Change in Control Payments.  Notwithstanding
anything in subsection 9.1 or 9.2 to the contrary, if, with respect to a
Participant, the acceleration of the vesting of an Incentive Award as
provided in subsection 9.1 or the payment of cash in exchange for all or
part of a Stock Option as provided in subsection 9.2 (which acceleration or
payment could be deemed a "payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code), together with any other payments that such
Participant has the right to receive from the Company or any corporation
that is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Section 1504(a) of
the Code without regard to Section 1504(b) of the Code) of which the
Company is a member, would constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments to such Participant
pursuant to subsection 9.1 or 9.2 shall be reduced to the largest amount as
will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.


                                   SECTION 10

                              General Provisions 

     10.1 No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or other person shall have
any claim to be granted any Incentive Award under the Plan, and there is no
obligation of uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or
beneficiaries of Incentive Awards under the Plan.  The terms and conditions
of Incentive Awards of the same type and the determination of the Committee
to grant a waiver or modification of any Incentive Award and the terms and
conditions thereof need not be the same with respect to each Participant.

     10.2 Withholding.  The Company or a Subsidiary shall be entitled to
(a) withhold and deduct from future wages of a Participant (or from other
amounts that may be due and owing to a Participant from the Company or a
Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally
required amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, state, and local
withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to an
Incentive Award, including, without limitation, the grant, exercise, or
vesting of, or payment of dividends with respect to, an Incentive Award or
a disqualifying disposition of Common Stock received upon exercise of an
incentive stock option; or (b) require a Participant promptly to remit the
amount of such withholding to the Company before taking any action with
respect to an Incentive Award.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise,
withholding may be satisfied by withholding Common Stock to be received
upon exercise or by delivery to the Company of previously owned Common
Stock.  The Company may establish such rules and procedures concerning
timing of any withholding election as it deems appropriate to comply with
Rule 16b-3 under the Act.

     10.3 Compliance With Laws; Listing and Registration of Shares.  All
Incentive Awards granted under the Plan (and all issuances of Common Stock
or other securities under the Plan) shall be subject to all applicable



                              -12-
laws, rules, and regulations, and to the requirement that if at any time
the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing,
registration, or qualification of the shares covered thereby upon any
securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as
a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of such Incentive Award or
the issue or purchase of shares thereunder, such Incentive Award may not be
exercised in whole or in part, or the restrictions on such Incentive Award
shall not lapse, unless and until such listing, registration,
qualification, consent, or approval shall have been effected or obtained
free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.

     10.4 No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained
in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from adopting or
continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements,
including the grant of stock options and other stock-based awards, and such
arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in
specific cases.

     10.5 No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Incentive Award shall
not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the
employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company or any Subsidiary may
at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability
or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the
Plan or in any written agreement with a Participant.

     10.6  Governing Law.  The validity, construction, and effect of the
Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined
in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable federal
law.

     10.7 Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be
held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall
not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be
construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been
included.


                                   SECTION 11

                           Termination and Amendment

          The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, or may from time to
time amend the Plan as it deems proper and in the best interests of the
Company, provided that without stockholder approval no such amendment may:
(a) materially increase either the benefits to Participants under the Plan
or the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan; (b) materially
modify the eligibility requirements; or (c) impair any outstanding
Incentive Award without the consent of the Participant, except according to
the terms of the Plan or the Incentive Award.  No termination, amendment,
or modification of the Plan shall become effective with respect to any


                              -13-
Incentive Award previously granted under the Plan without the prior written
consent of the Participant holding such Incentive Award unless such
amendment or modification operates solely to the benefit of the
Participant.


                                   SECTION 12

                    Effective Date and Duration of the Plan

          This Plan shall take effect April 27, 1993, subject to approval
by the stockholders at the 1993 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or any
adjournment thereof or at a Special Meeting of Stockholders.  Unless
earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the Plan shall terminate on
April 26, 2003.  No Incentive Award shall be granted under the Plan after
such date.

                               EXHIBIT 10(d)

                         WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

              Amended and Restated Directors Stock Option Plan


     1.   Establishment of Plan.  Wolverine World Wide, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Wolverine"), proposes to grant to its directors who are not
also employees of Wolverine ("Non-Employee Directors"), options to purchase
shares of Wolverine's Common Stock, $1 par value ("Common Stock").  The
options will be granted pursuant to the plan set forth herein which shall
be known as the WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED DIRECTORS
STOCK OPTION PLAN (the "Plan").


     2.   Purpose of Plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to advance the
interests of Wolverine and its stockholders by attracting and retaining the
services of experienced and knowledgeable Non-Employee Directors and to
provide additional incentive for such Non-Employee Directors to continue to
promote and work for the best interests of Wolverine and its stockholders
through continuing ownership of Wolverine Common Stock.


     3.   Shares Subject to Plan.  A maximum of 50,000 shares of Common
Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance with Paragraph 13 below) may be
subject to the exercise of options granted under the Plan.  Such shares
shall be authorized shares and may be unissued or treasury shares.  If an
option is canceled, surrendered, modified, exchanged for a substitute
option, or expires or terminates during the term of the Plan but prior to
the exercise of the option in full, the shares subject to but not delivered
under such option shall be available for options subsequently granted.


     4.   Administration of the Plan.  The Plan shall be administered by
the Stock Option Committee (the "Committee") consisting of three members
appointed by the Board of Directors.  The Committee shall have full power
and authority to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to supervise the
administration of the Plan.  All determinations made by the Committee
regarding the Plan shall be final and conclusive.  The Committee shall hold
its meetings at such times and places as it shall deem advisable. Action
may be taken by a written instrument signed by all the members of the
Committee, and any action so taken shall be fully as effective as if it had
been taken at a meeting duly called and held.  The Committee may designate
one of its members to sign options on behalf of the Committee and may
appoint a secretary to keep minutes of its meetings.  The Committee shall
make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business as it shall
deem advisable.  The members of the Committee shall be paid reasonable fees
for their services.





     5.   Indemnification of Committee Members.  Each person who is or
shall have been a member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Wolverine from and against any cost, liability, or expense
imposed or incurred in connection with such person's or the Committee's
taking or failing to take any action under the Plan.  Each such person
shall be justified in relying on information furnished in connection with
the Plan's administration by any appropriate person or persons.


     6.   Participation.  All directors who are directors on the date of
grant, who are not employees of Wolverine or any of its affiliates or
subsidiaries, and who are not eligible to participate under any other
Wolverine stock-related plan (unless in the opinion of counsel to Wolverine
such participation would not impair the status of such a Non-Employee
Director as a "disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3
issued under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) shall participate in the
Plan.  Each Non-Employee Director shall at the time of his or her initial
election or appointment be granted a non-qualified option to purchase 3,000
shares of Common Stock.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph 13,
a non-qualified option to purchase 500 shares of Common Stock shall be
granted automatically on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders
following the initial grant of 3,000 shares of Common Stock to each
director of Wolverine who is, at the close of each such annual meeting, a
Non-Employee Director.


     7.   Option Price.  The per share option price for an option granted
under the Plan shall be the market value of the shares covered by the
option at the time the option is granted.  The date of grant of the initial
options granted under the Plan shall be May 4, 1988, and the date of grant
of each option granted under the Plan from such date through April 20,
1994, shall be May 20 of the applicable year.  The date of all options
granted under the Plan on or after April 21, 1994, shall be the date of the
annual meeting of stockholders of the applicable year for annual grants and
the date of the initial election or appointment of a new Non-Employee
Director for the initial 3,000 share grant to a new Non-Employee Director. 
For purposes of this Plan, "market value" shall equal the mean of the
highest and lowest prices of sales of shares of Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on the last date preceding the date of grant on which
the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading and on which shares of
Common Stock were traded.


     8.   Termination of Directorship.  If a Non-Employee Director is no
longer a director of Wolverine or its subsidiaries for any reason other
than his or her death, disability, the reaching of mandatory retirement age
for a director, or termination for cause, he or she may exercise any
outstanding options for a period of three months after such termination of
director status, but only to the extent he or she was entitled to exercise




                                    -2-
the options on the date of termination, unless the terms of such option
provide otherwise.

          If a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a director of Wolverine
or one of its subsidiaries due to his or her disability or the attainment
of mandatory retirement age, he or she may exercise an option during the
remaining term of the option, but only to the extent that he or she was
entitled to exercise the option on the date of such event, unless the terms
of such option provide otherwise.

          If a Non-Employee Director dies either while a director of
Wolverine or after the termination of his or her directorship other than
for cause during the time when the participant could have exercised an
option under the Plan, the option issued to such Non-Employee Director
shall be exercisable by the personal representative of such Non-Employee
Director or other successor to the interest of the Non-Employee Director
for one year after his or her death, to the extent that the Non-Employee
Director was entitled to exercise the option on the date of death or
termination of director status, whichever first occurred, unless the terms
of such option provide otherwise.

          Nothing in the Plan or in any option agreement shall confer upon
any Non-Employee Director the right to continue as a director of Wolverine.


     9.   Transferability of Options.  Options granted under this Plan may
not be transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
During the lifetime of the Non-Employee Director, options may be exercised
only by that Non-Employee Director, or by his or her guardian or legal
representative.


     10.  Terms of Options.   Options shall expire ten (10) years from the
date of the granting thereof, but shall be subject to earlier termination
as provided in Paragraph 8.  Options shall be evidenced by written
agreements containing such terms and conditions, consistent with the
provisions of this Plan, as the Committee shall from time to time
determine.  Each agreement shall comply with and shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Plan and shall conclusively evidence, by the
Non-Employee Director's signature thereon, that it is the intent of the
Non-Employee Director to continue to serve as a director of Wolverine for
the remainder of his or her term during which the option was granted.  At
the time of the exercise of an option, the option holder, if requested by
the Committee, must represent to Wolverine that the shares are being
acquired for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof.


     11.  Time and Manner of Exercise.  Options are exercisable immediately
after their grant and may be exercised in full at one time or in part from
time to time.  Any option may be exercised by giving written notice, signed



                                    -3-
by the person exercising the option, to Wolverine stating the number of
shares with respect to which the option is being exercised, accompanied by
payment in full for such shares.


     12.  Medium and Time of Payment.  The exercise price of each share
purchased pursuant to an option granted under the Plan shall be payable in
cash or, if the Committee consents, in shares of Common Stock (including
Common Stock to be received upon a simultaneous exercise) or other
consideration equivalent to cash.  The time and terms of payment may be
amended with the consent of the Non-Employee Director before or after
exercise of the option, but such amendment shall not reduce the option
price.  When appropriate arrangements are made with a broker or other
institution, payment may be made by a properly executed exercise notice
directing delivery of shares to a broker together with irrevocable
instructions to the broker to promptly deliver to Wolverine the amount of
sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price.  The Committee may from
time to time authorize payment of all or a portion of the option price in
the form of a promissory note or installments, with or without interest or
security, according to such terms as the Committee may approve.  The Board
of Directors may restrict or suspend the power of the Committee to permit
such loans and may require that adequate security be provided.


     13.  Adjustments.  If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
changes by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares,
the aggregate number and class of shares available under the Plan and
subject to each option, together with the option prices, shall be
appropriately adjusted. No fractional shares shall be issued pursuant to
the Plan, and any fractional shares resulting from adjustments shall be
eliminated from the respective options.


     14.  Tax Withholding.  Wolverine or a subsidiary shall make such
provisions as it shall deem appropriate for the withholding of any taxes
determined to be required to be withheld in connection with the grant or
exercise of options under the Plan.


     15.  Listing and Registration of Shares.  Each option shall be subject
to the requirement that if at any time the Committee shall determine, in
its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the
shares covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any state or
federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory
body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with,
the granting of such option or the issue or purchase of shares thereunder,
such option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless and until such
listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been




                                    -4-
effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the
Committee.


     16.  Effective Date of Plan.  The Plan shall take effect May 4, 1988,
subject to approval by the stockholders at the 1988 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders or any adjournment thereof or at a Special Meeting of
Stockholders.  Options granted hereunder shall not be exercisable prior to
such stockholder approval and shall expire should the stockholders fail to
approve the Plan by May 4, 1989.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board of
Directors, the Plan shall terminate on May 4, 1998.  No option shall be
granted under this Plan after such date.


     17.  Termination and Amendment of Plan.  The Board of Directors may
terminate the Plan at any time or may from time to time amend the Plan as
it deems proper and in the best interests of Wolverine; provided, however,
that the Plan may not be amended more than once every six months, other
than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules
thereunder; and provided further, that, except as provided in Paragraph 13,
the Board may not, without the approval of the stockholders of Wolverine
obtained in the manner stated in Paragraph 16, do any of the following: 
(i) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the
Plan; (ii) materially increase the number of securities which may be issued
under the Plan; (iii) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility
for participation in the Plan; or (iv) materially increase the number of
shares for which an option may be granted to any Non-Employee Director.  No
such amendment or termination may impair any outstanding option without the
consent of the Non-Employee Director.

                                Exhibit 10(f)

                            AMENDED AND RESTATED
                            EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


          THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement")
is made as of April 27, 1993, by and between WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Employer"), and GEOFFREY B. BLOOM, an individual
(the "Executive"), and amends and restates in its entirety the Employment
Agreement between the parties dated May 8, 1992.


                             R E C I T A L S :

          Executive has been employed by Employer in an executive,
managerial and supervisory capacity.  Executive has held the offices of
President and Chief Operating Officer of Employer and currently holds the
offices of President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

          Executive has an existing employment agreement with Employer
dated May 8, 1992.  In recognition of the appointment of Executive to the
office of Chief Executive Officer and the additional responsibilities that
accompany such appointment, the parties desire to amend the existing
employment agreement and restate in a single document the agreement of the
parties which supersedes all prior employment agreements.

          Employer is desirous of being assured of the continued services
of Executive for a minimum term ending on April 30, 1997.  Executive is
willing to continue in the employ of Employer for such term, and desires to
have the terms and conditions of such continued employment reduced to
writing.

          THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

     1.   Employment.  Employer hereby agrees to continue to employ
Executive and Executive agrees to continue to serve Employer in an
executive, managerial and supervisory capacity on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

     2.   Position and Duties.  Executive shall serve as President and
Chief Executive Officer of Employer reporting only to Employer's Board of
Directors.  Executive shall have supervision and control over, and
responsibility for, the general management and operation of Employer, and
shall have such other powers and duties as may from time to time be
prescribed by Employer's Board of Directors.  Subject to the foregoing,
Executive agrees to devote his best efforts and substantially all his
working time and attention to the business of Employer and its
subsidiaries, and to the performance of such executive, managerial and
supervisory duties as may be assigned to him by Employer's Board of
Directors; provided, that Executive shall be permitted to serve on a
reasonable number of boards of directors of other companies, subject to the
prior consent of Employer's Board of Directors, and render occasional
services in connection with such service, and Executive shall be permitted
to participate in charitable and civic endeavors to the extent such service
does not interfere with Executive's obligations under this Agreement.

     3.   Term.  Except in the case of early termination as specifically
provided in this Agreement, the term of Executive's employment shall be for
the period beginning effective as of April 27, 1993, and ending April 30,
1997.

     4.   Compensation.  For the services to be rendered by Executive as
provided in this Agreement, Employer agrees to pay Executive during the
term hereof in thirteen (13) equal installments during each year of such
term, a base salary of not less than Three Hundred Thirty Thousand
($330,000) Dollars per annum, payable effective as of April 27, 1993. 
Executive's base salary may be increased at the discretion of Employer's
Board of Directors and/or its Compensation Committee at any time and from
time to time during the term of this Agreement.  Upon any such increase in
Executive's base salary, the new rate shall without further action by the
parties be deemed to be substituted for the rate set forth in this
Agreement and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended accordingly.

     5.   Fringe Benefits.

          (a)  In addition to the compensation provided in Section 4
     of this Agreement, Executive shall also be entitled to the
     following fringe benefits:

               (i)  Executive shall participate in both the Executive
          Long-Term Incentive (Three Year) Plan and the Executive
          Short-Term Incentive Plan, or any successor or substitute
          plans, and in such other bonus plans as may be made
          available to upper echelon executives of Employer.

               (ii) Executive shall be entitled to a leased automobile
          of a type to be mutually agreed upon by Executive and
          Employer.  In addition, Employer shall pay maintenance and
          all other operating expenses, including gasoline, repairs
          and insurance, with respect to such automobile in accordance
          with applicable regulations issued or administered by the
          Internal Revenue Service.

              (iii)      Employer shall pay for reasonable dues,
          assessments, and other non-discretionary expenses and all
          business related expenses, associated with a membership in
          two country clubs or similar luncheon or social
          organizations in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area to be
          selected by Executive.

              (iv)  Employer shall provide Executive with the benefits
          of a term life insurance policy in the amount of Five
          Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) payable to his
          designated beneficiaries, in addition to the benefits of all

                                    -2-

          other life insurance plans as provided in this Agreement. 
          Upon termination of this Agreement (except for voluntary
          resignation by Executive or termination of Executive for
          Cause), such Five Hundred Thousand Dollar ($500,000) life
          insurance policy shall be assigned to Executive and Employer
          shall pay all premiums due after any such assignment until
          the expiration of the original term of this Agreement.  In
          the event of voluntary resignation by Executive or
          termination of Executive for Cause, at Executive's option,
          such life insurance policy shall be assigned to Executive
          and Executive shall pay all premiums due after such
          assignment.

               (v)  Employer shall provide Executive with tax
          preparation services and financial planning advice and
          services consistent with Employer's past practice or as may
          be made available to upper echelon executives of Employer.

              (vi)  Employer shall pay Executive's reasonable legal
          expenses related to the negotiation and execution of this
          Agreement.

              (vii) Executive shall be entitled to four (4) weeks of
          vacation per year, plus such additional vacation as may be
          permitted with the concurrence of Employer's Board of
          Directors.  Executive shall further be entitled to all
          benefits in the way of "fringes" presently available or
          which may subsequently be made available to upper echelon
          executives of Employer as a class or benefits substantially
          equivalent thereto, so long as such benefits or plans are in
          effect, including but not limited to, participation in the
          Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Employees' Pension Plan; the
          Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Employees' Profit-Sharing and
          Savings Plan; the Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Non-Qualified
          Stock Option Plan of 1979 and any amendments thereto; the
          Wolverine World Wide, Inc. 1984 Executive Incentive Stock
          Purchase Plan; the Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive
          Incentive Bonus Plan; the Wolverine World Wide, Inc.
          Employee Loan Program; the Wolverine World Wide, Inc. 1993
          Stock Incentive Plan; and all group life, disability,
          hospitalization, medical, dental and surgical benefit plans
          presently or hereafter in effect and available to upper
          echelon executives of Employer, or their equivalent.

              (viii)  Employer shall provide Executive with a Deferred
          Compensation Agreement mutually agreed upon by both parties
          which, assuming Executive does not voluntarily resign or is
          not terminated for Cause, provides for payments to Executive
          or his assigns in the amount of One Hundred Twenty Thousand
          Dollars ($120,000) per year for eighteen (18) consecutive
          years commencing at age fifty-eight (58) or, at Executive's


                                    -3-

          sole discretion, at such later age or date as Executive may
          elect.

               (ix) In the event that Executive does not voluntarily
          terminate his employment (for purposes of this Section,
          Termination for Disability, Good Reason or death shall not
          be considered voluntary termination) or is not terminated
          for Cause prior to January 1, 1994, then Employer shall
          forgive one-half of the total indebtedness, One Hundred Five
          Thousand Four Hundred Sixty-four Dollars and Eighty-five
          Cents ($105,464.85), plus accrued interest, of Executive to
          Employer incurred in connection with the purchase of 22,500
          shares of Employer's common stock.  In the event that
          Executive does not voluntarily terminate his employment or
          is not terminated for Cause prior to May 8, 1994, then
          Employer shall forgive the remainder of the total
          indebtedness, plus accrued interest, of Executive to
          Employer incurred in connection with the purchase of such
          shares.  In addition, upon forgiveness of any part of such
          indebtedness, Employer shall loan to Executive an amount
          equal to the federal and state income taxes resulting from
          such forgiveness of indebtedness.  Such loan shall bear no
          interest and shall be repaid in three (3) equal annual
          installments commencing on the first anniversary date of
          such loan.

          (b)  Notwithstanding any provision or term of this Agreement
     to the contrary, Employer shall not be required or obligated to
     maintain, amend or adopt any particular fringe benefit plan or
     policy, including those plans or policies referenced in this
     Section, or to pay, credit or otherwise vest in Executive as a
     participant any amount or level of award or grant under any such
     plan; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to
     any deferred bonus, payment or other credit awarded to Executive
     under any such plan.

     6.   Additional Benefits.  The provisions of this Agreement with
respect to compensation and other benefits payable to Executive shall not
preclude or in any way affect the grant by Employer or the receipt by
Executive of increases in base salary or total compensation, or bonuses, or
additional compensation, contingent or otherwise, to be determined solely
in the discretion of Employer's Board of Directors and/or its Compensation
Committee, or by other persons or groups to whom such authority is legally
delegated.

     7.   Expenses.  In addition to the compensation and benefits provided
in Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement, Employer will reimburse or pay
Executive's reasonable and appropriate expenses for his business related
travel and entertainment in accordance with Employer's then current policy.
As a condition to such reimbursement or payment, Executive shall be
required to account to Employer for expenses incurred in the performance of


                                    -4-

his employment duties.  Executive shall be entitled, if Executive deems it
appropriate, to bring his spouse with him on up to two out of town trips
involving business of Employer per year, and Employer shall reimburse
Executive or pay the reasonable and appropriate expenses incurred for her
travel and entertainment.  Employer may pay the travel and entertainment
expenses of Executive's spouse incurred on more than two business trips per
year with the prior approval of Employer's Board of Directors, and/or its
Compensation Committee.

     8.   Renewal of Term of Employment.

          (a)  Unless Employer delivers written notice to Executive on
     or prior to May 1, 1996, of its intention not to renew
     Executive's term of employment for an additional three (3) year
     term, then Executive's term of employment shall be automatically
     renewed for an additional three-year term commencing May 1, 1997,
     and ending on April 30, 2000, on the same terms and conditions
     set forth in this Agreement.

          (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 10 and 14
     hereof, if Employer terminates Executive's employment during the
     original or renewal term of this Agreement, or elects not to
     renew Executive's term of employment following expiration of the
     original term of this Agreement, then Employer shall pay to
     Executive on the earlier of the date of termination or May 1,
     1997, a lump sum payment equal to two hundred percent (200%) of
     Executive's then current annual base salary.  In addition, except
     as otherwise provided in Sections 10 and 14 hereof, if Employer
     terminates Executive's employment during the original or renewal
     term of this Agreement, or elects not to renew Executive's term
     of employment following expiration of the original term of this
     Agreement, Executive shall be credited with an additional three
     (3) years of continuous service at Executive's salary rate in
     effect on the Date of Termination for purposes of computing
     Executive's benefits under the Wolverine World Wide, Inc.
     Employees' Pension Plan such that, following the termination of
     Executive's employment, Executive shall receive benefits from
     such plan (or such supplemental plan as may be necessary to
     provide such benefits) effective at age fifty-eight (58) as if
     Executive had thirteen (13) years of service with Employer. 
     Executive may elect to commence payments upon attaining age
     fifty-eight (58) or at a later date as permitted under the
     general provisions of such plan, and such payments shall be based
     upon the additional three (3) years of service credited to
     Executive as provided in this Section.


     9.   Disability and Retirement.

          (a)  If, as a result of Executive's incapacity due to
     physical or mental illness, he shall have been absent from his


                                    -5-

     duties with Employer on a full time basis for six (6) consecutive
     months, and if he shall have not returned to the full time
     performance of his duties within thirty (30) days after written
     notice after such six (6) month period, Employer may terminate
     this Agreement for "Disability."

          (b)  Termination of Executive's employment by Employer or
     Executive based on "Retirement" shall mean termination in
     accordance with Employer's retirement policy generally applicable
     to salaried employees or in accordance with any retirement
     arrangement applicable to him established with Executive's
     consent.

     10.  Termination for Cause.  Employer may terminate Executive's
employment for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean: 
(a) the willful and continued failure by Executive to substantially perform
his duties with Employer (other than any such failure resulting from
Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness, or any such
actual or anticipated failure resulting from Executive's termination for
Good Reason) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to
Executive by Employer's Board of Directors and/or its Chairman (which
demand shall specifically identify the manner in which the Board and/or its
Chairman believes that Executive has not substantially performed his
duties); or (b) the commission of a felony injurious to Employer or its
reputation, as determined by Employer's Board of Directors.  For purposes
of this Section, no act or failure to act on the part of Executive shall be
considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by Executive not in
good faith and without reasonable belief that his action(s) or omission(s)
was in the best interests of Employer.  If Executive's employment is
terminated for Cause, or if Executive voluntarily terminates his employment
other than for Good Reason, Disability or Retirement, then Employer shall
pay Executive his full base salary through the Date of Termination (as
provided in this Agreement) at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
Termination is given, and Employer shall have no further obligations to
Executive under this Agreement or under the Deferred Compensation
Agreement.

     11.  Termination for Good Reason.  Executive may terminate his
employment at any time for Good Reason and, in such event, Employer shall
continue to be obligated to pay Executive the amounts and benefits set
forth in Section 14 of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement,
"Good Reason" shall, without Executive's express written consent, mean:

          (a)  The assignment to Executive of any duties inconsistent
     with his present positions, duties, responsibilities and status
     with Employer as President and Chief Executive Officer, or a
     change in Executive's reporting responsibilities in such
     capacities, titles or offices from those in effect as of the date
     hereof, or any removal of Executive from, or failure to re-elect
     him as President and Chief Executive Officer, except in
     connection with the termination of his employment for Cause,


                                    -6-

     Disability or Retirement or as a result of his death or by
     Executive other than for Good Reason;

          (b)  A reduction by Employer in Executive's annual base
     salary as provided in this Agreement or as the same may be
     increased from time to time, except for across-the-board salary
     reductions, freezes or reduced increases similarly affecting all
     executives of Employer;

          (c)  A failure by Employer to continue the Employer's
     Executive Incentive Bonus Plan as such plan may be modified from
     time to time but substantially in the form presently in effect
     (the "Plan"), or a failure by Employer to continue Executive as a
     participant in the Plan or to pay Executive any annual
     installment of a previous award under the Plan or any Deferred
     Distribution (as defined in the Plan) awarded under the Plan;

          (d)  The relocation of Employer's principal executive
     offices to a location outside Rockford, Michigan, or any
     requirement that Executive be based anywhere other than
     Employer's principal executive offices, except for required
     travel on Employer's business to an extent substantially
     consistent with Executive's present business travel obligations,
     or, in the event Executive consents to any such relocation of
     Employer's principal executive offices, the failure by Employer
     to pay (or reimburse Executive for) all reasonable moving
     expenses incurred by Executive relating to a change of
     Executive's principal residence in connection with such
     relocation and to indemnify Executive against any loss (defined
     as the difference between the actual sale price of such residence
     and the higher of (i) Executive's aggregate investment in such
     residence or (ii) the fair market value of such residence as
     determined by a real estate appraiser designated by Executive and
     reasonably satisfactory to Employer) realized in the sale of
     Executive's principal residence in connection with any such
     relocation;

          (e)  The failure by Employer to continue to provide
     Executive with benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by
     Executive under any benefit or compensation plan (including but
     not limited to Employer's 1979 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan,
     1988 Stock Option Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan), pension,
     life insurance, medical, health and accident or disability plan
     in which Executive is currently participating, the taking of any
     action by Employer which would adversely affect Executive's
     participation in or materially reduce Executive's benefits under
     any of such plans or deprive Executive of any material fringe
     benefit currently enjoyed by Executive, or the failure by
     Employer to provide Executive with the number of paid vacation
     days to which Executive is then entitled on the basis of years of
     service with Employer in accordance with this Agreement and


                                    -7-

     Employer's normal vacation policy in effect on the date of this
     Agreement;

          (f)  The failure of Employer to obtain the assumption of
     Employer's obligations under this Agreement by any successor as
     contemplated in Section 16 of this Agreement;

          (g)  Any purported termination of Executive's employment
     which is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination which
     satisfies the requirements of Section 12 below (and, if
     applicable, Section 10 above); or

          (h)  Any other material breach by Employer of its
     obligations under this Agreement.

     12.  Notice of Termination.  Any purported termination of this
Agreement by Employer or by Executive shall be communicated by written
Notice of Termination to the other party.  For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the
specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon (except in the
event of termination of Executive without Cause) and shall set forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis
for termination of Executive's employment under the provision so indicated
(including, if applicable, the requirements of Section 10 hereof).

     13.  Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" shall mean (a) if
this Agreement is terminated for Disability, the time specified in
Section 9 of this Agreement, and (b) if Executive's employment is
terminated for any reason other than Disability, the date specified in the
Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 11 above shall not be more than sixty (60) days from the date such
Notice of Termination is given); provided, that, if within thirty (30) days
after any Notice of Termination is given the party receiving such Notice of
Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the
termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute
is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties or
by a binding arbitration award; and provided further, that the Date of
Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice is
given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues the resolution
of such dispute with reasonable diligence.  Notwithstanding the pendency of
any such dispute, Employer will continue to pay Executive his full
compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given
(including, but not limited to, base salary) and continue Executive as a
participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, in which Executive was participating when the
notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is finally
resolved in accordance with this Section.  Amounts paid under this
Section are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and
shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this
Agreement; provided, however, in the event that the Date of Termination
shall be extended by a notice of dispute and such dispute is resolved in


                                    -8-

favor of the Employer, than the Employer may credit and offset any
compensation paid to Executive after the date specified in the Notice of
Termination against any payments due to Executive hereunder or, at
Employer's option, such payments shall be reimbursed by the Executive to
Employer.

     14.  Compensation Upon Termination.

          (a)  If Employer shall terminate Executive's employment
     other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability, or if Executive
     shall terminate his employment for Good Reason, then, in lieu of
     the payments provided under Sections 4, 5 and 8 of this
     Agreement, Employer shall pay to Executive as severance pay (the
     "Severance Payments") in a lump sum on the fifth day following
     the Date of Termination, the following amounts:

               (i)  Executive's base salary through the Date of
          Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
          Termination is given and an amount equal to the amount, if
          any, of the deferred portion of any awards which pursuant to
          the Plan have been awarded to Executive but which have not
          yet been paid to Executive as well as a bonus for the year
          prior to termination if not yet awarded and for the year of
          termination prorated through the date of termination, both
          based on 100% of any bonus awarded Executive for the
          immediately preceding year, or the average of Executive's
          bonus awards pursuant to the Plan for the two immediately
          preceding years, whichever is greater, and including in
          either case the amount of Deferred Compensation, if any,
          under the Plan which has accrued to Executive's account;

               (ii) In lieu of any further salary payments to
          Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination,
          Employer shall pay Executive the present value (as computed
          in Section 14(h) below), of the product of (A) the sum of
          Executive's annual base salary at the rate in effect on the
          Date of Termination plus the amount awarded Executive under
          the Plan during the year most recently ended (whether or not
          fully paid), and (B) the number of years (rounded to the
          nearest hundredth) between the Date of Termination and April
          30, 1997;

              (iii)      Employer shall also pay all relocation and
          indemnity payments as set forth in Section 11(d) of this
          Agreement;

              (iv)  All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by
          Executive as a result of such termination if Executive
          substantially prevails in enforcing his rights under this
          Agreement (including all such fees and expenses, if any,
          incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination or


                                    -9-

          in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit
          provided by this Agreement);

               (v)  In lieu of the $1.00 par value per share common
          stock of Employer ("Company Shares") issuable upon the
          exercise of options, (other than options granted after
          May 8, 1992 as incentive stock options in accordance with
          the provisions of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code
          of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), under Employer's 1988
          Stock Option Plan, or any other stock option plan now or
          subsequently adopted by the Employer (which options shall be
          canceled upon payment of the amount set forth below),
          Executive shall receive an amount in cash equal to one
          hundred fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate positive
          spread between the exercise prices of all such options held
          by Executive, whether or not then fully exercisable, and the
          higher of (A) the closing price of Company Shares as
          reported on the New York Stock Exchange on or nearest the
          Date of Termination, or (B) the highest price per Company
          share actually paid in connection with any change in control
          of Employer;

               
              (vi)  In lieu of the Company Shares issuable upon the
          exercise of options granted after May 8, 1992 which are then
          exercisable, which options have been granted as incentive
          stock options in accordance with the provisions of
          Section 422A of the Code, under Employer's 1988 Stock Option
          Plan, or any other stock option plan now or subsequently
          adopted by Employer (which options shall be canceled upon
          payment of the amount set forth below), Executive shall
          receive an amount in cash equal to the aggregate positive
          spread between the exercise prices of all such options held
          by Executive which are then exercisable and the closing
          price of Company Shares as reported on the New York Stock
          Exchange on or nearest the Date of Termination.  Executive
          shall receive such amount for any unexpired incentive stock
          options, whether or not the exercise date of such stock
          options has passed, provided such options would have been
          exercisable prior to April 30, 1997;

              (vii) The amount set forth in Section 8(b) of this
          Agreement (which shall not be subject to mitigation as
          provided in Section 15 hereof); and

             (viii)      In the event that any restrictions against
          sale, transfer or other disposition of Company Shares
          provided in the 1984 Plan have not lapsed on the Date of
          Termination, Employer shall declare the restrictions to have
          lapsed with respect to those shares, provided such
          restrictions would have lapsed prior to April 30, 1997.


                                    -10-
          (b)  Unless Executive is terminated for Cause, Employer
     shall maintain in full force and effect, for continued benefit
     after the Date of Termination, all employee benefit plans and
     programs or arrangements in which Executive was entitled to
     participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination (except
     for bonus and stock option plans) provided that Executive's
     continued participation is possible under the general terms and
     provisions of such plans and programs until the last to expire of
     six months after the Date of Termination, or the date upon which
     Executive is engaged in an equivalent position and entitled to
     participate in such other employer's employee benefits, in no
     event to exceed one (1) year following the Date of Termination. 
     In the event that Executive's participation in any such plan or
     program is barred, Employer shall arrange to provide Executive
     with benefits substantially similar to those which Executive is
     entitled to receive under such plans and programs.  At the end of
     the period of coverage, Executive shall have the option to have
     assigned to him at no cost and with no apportionment of prepaid
     premiums, any assignable insurance policy owned by Employer and
     relating specifically to Executive.

          (c)  If Employer shall terminate Executive's employment
     other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability, or if Executive
     shall terminate his employment for Good Reason, then in addition
     to the benefits to which Executive is entitled under the
     retirement plans or programs in which Executive participates or
     any successor plans or programs in effect on the Date of
     Termination, Employer shall pay Executive in one lump sum in cash
     at Executive's normal retirement age (or earlier retirement age
     should Executive so elect) as defined in the retirement plans or
     programs in effect on the Date of Termination, an amount equal to
     the actuarial equivalent of the retirement pension to which
     Executive would have been entitled under the terms of such
     retirement plans or programs without regard to any vesting
     requirements of such plans or programs, had Executive accumulated
     three (3) additional years of continuous service (after any
     termination pursuant to Section 3) at Executive's salary rate in
     effect on the Date of Termination plus the amount awarded
     Executive under the plan during the year most recently ended
     (whether or not fully paid) (including subsequent annual salary
     adjustments) under such retirement plans or programs reduced by
     the single sum actuarial equivalent of any amount to which
     Executive is entitled pursuant to the provisions of such
     retirement plans and programs.  For purposes of this Subsection,
     "actuarial equivalent" shall be determined using the same methods
     and assumptions utilized under Employer's retirement plans and
     programs immediately prior to any change in control.

          (d)  If Employer shall terminate Executive's employment
     other than for Cause, Retirement or Disability, or if Executive
     shall terminate his employment for Good Reason, Employer shall


                                    -11-

     provide Executive with executive out-placement services by
     entering into a contract with a company specializing in such
     services.

          (e)  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
     contrary, if part or all of any amount to be paid to Executive by
     the Employer under this Agreement constitutes a "parachute
     payment" (or payments) under Section 280G or any other similar
     provision of the Code, the following limitation shall apply:

               If the aggregate present value of such parachute
     payments (the "Parachute Amount") exceeds 2.99 times Executive's
     "base amount" as defined in Section 280G of the Code, then the
     amount otherwise payable to or for the benefit of Executive
     subsequent to the termination of his employment and taken into
     account in calculating the Parachute Amount (the "Termination
     Payments"), shall be reduced and/or delayed, as further described
     below, to the extent necessary so that the Parachute Amount is
     equal to 2.99 times Executive's "base amount."

               Any determination or calculation described in this
     Section shall be made by the Employer's independent accountants. 
     Such determination, and any proposed reduction and/or delay in
     Termination Payments shall be furnished in writing promptly by
     the accountants to Executive.  Executive may then elect, in his
     sole discretion, which and how much of any particular Termination
     Payment shall be reduced and/or delayed and shall advise Employer
     in writing of his election, within thirty (30) days of the
     accountant's determination of the reduction and/or delay in
     Termination Payments.  If no such election is made by Executive
     within such thirty (30) day period, Employer may elect which and
     how much of any termination payment shall be reduced or delayed
     and shall notify Executive promptly of such election.  As
     promptly as practicable following such determination and the
     elections hereunder, Employer shall pay to or distribute to or
     for the benefit of Executive such amounts as are then due to
     Executive.

          (f)  Any disagreement regarding a reduction and/or delay in
     Termination Payments will be subject to arbitration under
     Section 21 of this Agreement.  Neither Executive's designation of
     specific payments to be reduced and/or delayed, nor Executive's
     acceptance of reduced and/or delayed payments, shall waive
     Executive's right to contest such reduction and/or delay.

          (g)  It is the belief of the parties that none of the
     payments provided for in this Agreement is or will be a
     "parachute payment."

          (h)  In computing the "present value" of payments under
     Section 14(b) above, each payment shall be discounted from the


                                    -12-

     date it would have boon received had the employment continued to
     the date of actual payment.  The discount rate shall equal one
     hundred twenty (120) percent of the applicable federal rate
     (determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code, and the
     regulations promulgated thereunder) compounded semiannually.  The
     applicable federal rate will be the federal rate in effect on the
     date as of which the present value is determined.

     15.  Mitigation.

          (a)  Executive shall be required to mitigate the payments
     upon termination described in Section 14 of this Agreement, in
     accordance with applicable law governing mitigation of damages. 
     During the period Employer is obligated to make payments or
     provide benefits to Executive under Section 14, Executive will
     notify Employer in writing of any other employment or self-
     employment in which Executive engages.

          (b)  The parties both believe and agree that it would not be
     reasonable to expect Executive to mitigate damages during the
     period covered under Section 14 by seeking or accepting
     employment which is not substantially equivalent in all material
     respects (including without limitation level of responsibility,
     compensation, benefits and working conditions) to Executive's
     position with Employer.  The parties also believe and agree that
     it would not be reasonable to require Executive to mitigate
     damages during the period covered under Section 14 by seeking or
     accepting employment outside the West Michigan Area. In addition,
     nothing in this Section 15 shall be construed to require
     Executive to actively seek employment to mitigate the amount of
     payments due to him hereunder.

               If Executive does earn income from other employment, or
     net income from self-employment, during the period payments are
     due under Section 14, the parties believe that the amount of any
     such earnings (including the cash value of any fringe benefits)
     should be deducted from the amount payable under Section 14,
     subject to the following conditions.  The parties believe and
     agree that it would be reasonable and proper, before deducting
     any other earnings from payments due under Section 14, to reduce
     those other earnings by any expenses incurred by Executive in
     obtaining such other earnings, including but not limited to
     moving expenses, employment agency fees and, if the Executive
     sells his residence in Kent County, Michigan, in order to
     relocate, the amount of any loss on that residence (computed as
     the difference between the sales price (net of real estate
     commissions and other selling costs) and the greater of (i)
     Executive's aggregate capital investment in such residence, or
     (ii) the fair market value of such residence as determined by
     agreement between the parties or, if the parties are unable to



                                    -13-

     agree, by an independent appraisal by a qualified real estate
     appraiser reasonably acceptable to both parties).

               The recitations in this Subsection are intended to set
     forth the expectations, intentions and beliefs of the parties as
     to what would constitute reasonable mitigation, which the parties
     have each relied upon in entering into this Agreement.  Nothing
     in this Agreement is intended to change the allocation under
     applicable law of burden of proof concerning mitigation of
     damages, in the event of any dispute.

          (c)  If Executive receives a payment under Section 14, which
     subsequently becomes subject to mitigation under this Section due
     to earnings of Executive from subsequent employment or self-
     employment, Executive shall repay to Employer that portion of
     such payment which has been mitigated.  Such repayment shall be
     adjusted, however, to reflect the reduced "present value" amount
     actually received by Executive under Section 14.

     16.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

          (a)  Employer will require any successor (whether direct or
     indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all
     or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Employer,
     to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the
     same manner and to the same extent that Employer would be
     required to perform this Agreement if no such succession had
     occurred.  Failure of Employer to obtain such assumption and
     agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall
     be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to
     compensation from Employer in the same amount and on the same
     terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder if Executive
     terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
     purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any
     such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
     Termination.  As used in this Agreement, "Employer" shall mean
     Employer as defined in this Agreement and any successor to its
     business and/or assets which assumes and agrees to perform this

     17.  Noncompetition.  Recognizing that his skill, experience and
knowledge are unique and are a material inducement to Employer to enter
into this Agreement, Executive agrees that during the original and any
renewal term of this Agreement, and prior to his attaining age fifty-eight
(58), Executive will not enter employment with, or, directly or indirectly,
own an interest in, or manage, operate, control or participate in the
business of, any company whose business is similar to or in competition
with that of Employer without the express authorization of Employer's Board
of Directors.  This provision shall not, however, restrict the right of
Executive to own stock in any company listed on a national or regional
stock exchange, regardless of the nature of its business.  The parties
hereto agree that in view of all the facts and circumstances, this
provision is neither an unreasonable restraint nor unconscionable.

     18.  Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is
agreed to in a writing signed by Executive and such officer as may be
specifically designated by Employer's Board of Directors.  No waiver by
either party at any time of any breach by the other party of, or compliance
with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such
other party shall be deemed a waiver of the same or similar or dissimilar
provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. 
No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied,
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement have been made by
either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.  The
validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan.

     19.  Validity.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

     20.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     21.  Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in
connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by binding
arbitration in Rockford, Michigan, in accordance with the rules of the
American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Judgment may be entered

however, that Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
his right to be paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of
any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
Agreement.

     22.  War or National Emergency.  Employer agrees that, in the event of
a war or national emergency, Executive will, at his request, be granted a
leave of absence for military or governmental service and during said
period of leave of absence shall be paid such compensation as may be fixed
by, or with the authority of Employer's Board of Directors.  During any


                                    -15-

such leave of absence, Executive shall, except with respect to his rights

                    EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

                                  FOR 1994


                                 ARTICLE I

                         ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN

1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, as
     described herein, is established by Wolverine World Wide, Inc.
     (Company) for the fiscal year of 1994, and may be continued, intact or
     as amended, from year to year, at the Company's option.

1.2  The Objectives of the Plan are to:

     (a)  Motivate participants to improve the Company's profitability and
          growth by the attainment of carefully planned earnings, sales,
          and other contributory goals.

     (b)  Promote initiative and cooperation with awards based on division
          and corporate earnings.

     (c)  Encourage outstanding individuals to enter and continue in the
          employ of the Company.


                                 ARTICLE II

                               PARTICIPATION

2.1  Participants shall be certain senior division and corporate employees
     designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the
     Company and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board.

2.2  Employees enrolled during the first two periods of the fiscal year are
     eligible for all the applicable award for that year.  Employees
     enrolled during the third through the sixth period are eligible for
     one-half of any applicable award.  Employees enrolled thereafter shall
     not be eligible for any award for that fiscal year.


                                ARTICLE III

                             PERFORMANCE GOALS

3.1  The units of measure in the Plan are described below:



     (a)  Unit Goals (operating divisions or profit centers) are measured
          by the attainment of predetermined (1) Profit Before Tax (80-100%
          weighting), (2) Annual Sales (0-20% weighting).

          Unit (divisional) participants will generally have their bonus
          comprised of unit profits of 56%, unit sales of 14%, corporate
          goals (profits and sales) of 15%, and personal goals of 15%. 
          Note:  Personal goals will be computed and paid by multiplying
          the participants' percentage achievement times 150% of target
          payout for the personal goal element.  No credit will be given
          for achieving personal goals if threshold profit goals are not
          attained unless specifically approved by the Compensation
          Committee.  

     (b)  Corporate goals are measured by the attainment of predetermined
          (1) Corporate-wide Profit Before Tax, Bonus, and 401(k) Plan
          (PBTB4), (80% weighting) and (2) Corporate-wide Sales, (20%
          weighting) objectives.  

          Corporate participants will generally have their bonus comprised
          of corporate profits 64%, corporate sales 16% and personal goals
          20%.  Note:  Personal goals will be computed and paid by
          multiplying the participants' percentage achievement times the
          maximum payout for the personal goal element.  No credit will be
          given for achieving personal goals if threshold profit goals are
          not attained unless specifically approved by the Compensation
          Committee.

3.2  This plan recognizes three Levels of Goal Attainment for profit and
     sales attainment:

     (a)  Target attainment which qualifies for 100% of eligible bonus.

     (b)  Threshold attainment which qualifies for 50% of eligible bonus.

     (c)  Maximum attainment which qualifies for 150% of eligible bonus.

     (d)  Super Maximum.  In addition, achievement above stated maximum
          goal attainment will qualify the participant for up to an
          additional 50% of target bonus payment (Super-Maximum).  This
          additional potential incentive will be paid on a pro-rata basis
          if profits achieved are between stated maximum and super-maximum
          objectives.

          Target, Threshold, and Maximum and Super Maximum goals as well as
          unit and corporate weightings are approved by the Compensation
          Committee.  These goals are attached according to your
          unit(s)/corporate assignment.  Personal goals have also been
          communicated to each participant.

3.3  Attainment levels falling between goals (i.e. Threshold Target,
     Maximum, and Super Maximum goals) will cause the award level to be

                                    -2-
     adjusted by the use straight-line interpolation between the
     appropriate levels.

3.4  Each individual eligible for this Plan has been assigned a target
     bonus percentage.  These targets are determined based on
     responsibility and/or performance levels and approved by the
     Compensation Committee.

3.5  A participant's actual bonus for 1994 is determined by applying the
     Target Bonus to the Level of Goal Attainment for the unit(s) and/or
     corporate to which the participant has been assigned for purposes of
     this Plan. 

3.6  Each Plan participant has been assigned to one or more units and/or
     corporate.  This assignment is expressed as a percentage (0-100%) and
     is based on the participant's position and responsibility in the
     Company.  Thus, a participant's final bonus calculation will be the
     sum of each assigned unit/corporate achievement multiplied by his/her
     assigned percentage in that unit(s) and/or corporate.

3.7  The formula therefore for calculating an individual's bonus is as
     follows:  Bonus equals base salary paid in 1994 multiplied by the
     eligible Target Bonus multiplied by the Level of Goal Attainment
     against target goals by the unit(s)/corporate area to which a
     participant is assigned. 

     Bonus = Salary X Eligible Target % X Weighted Level of Goal
     Attainment.

3.8  Plan Participants will have this Plan and their individual goals,
     assignments, and factors explained to them.  Information will be
     provided quarterly showing estimated progress toward the established
     goals.


                                 ARTICLE IV

                             GENERAL PROVISIONS

4.1  Payout of Awards.

     Bonuses earned under the Plan will be paid as soon as is practicable
     after the completion of the audit of the Company's books for the
     fiscal year and approval of the awards by the Compensation Committee
     of the Board of Directors.

4.2  Eligibility for Payment.

     Only those employees actively at work on the last day of the fiscal
     year shall be eligible for any bonus earned that year.  In addition,
     the Compensation Committee of the Board may, at its discretion,
     interpret or modify this Plan and make other awards if a termination

                                    -3-
     is due to disability, retirement or death prior to the end of the
     year.

4.3  Employment Rights.

     The Plan shall not be construed to give and does not give any employee
     the right to be continued in the employ of the Company.


                                 ARTICLE V

                          SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS

5.1  Maximum Bonus.

     There will be no limitation on the total maximum bonuses as long as
     the payment of bonuses and dividends is not greater than corporate
     PBTB4.  If, however, corporate earnings were below the Threshold goal,
     then bonuses in those units attaining Target goal or greater would not
     be reduced below Target Bonus nor would bonuses in units earning
     between Threshold and Target goals be reduced below Threshold Bonuses.


5.2  Compensation Committee Discretion.

     Notwithstanding the above, the Compensation Committee of the Board
     reserves the right to reduce the formula bonus of any participant
     deemed not to have performed satisfactorily in his or her
     position/assignment during the year.  

     Likewise the Compensation Committee may increase a formula bonus if
     there is compelling reason to do so.

1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Management Short-Term Incentive Plan,
     as described herein, is established by Wolverine World Wide, Inc.

                               PARTICIPATION

2.1  Participants shall be certain key division and corporate employees
     designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the
     Company and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board.

2.2  Employees enrolled during the first two periods of the fiscal year are
     eligible for all the applicable award for that year.  Employees
     enrolled during the third through the sixth period are eligible for

     (a)  Unit Goals (operating divisions or profit centers) are measured
          by the attainment of predetermined (1) Profit Before Tax (80-100%
          weighting), (2) Annual Sales (0-20% weighting).

     (b)  Corporate goals are measured by the attainment of predetermined
          (1)  Corporate-wide Profit Before Tax, Bonus, and 401(k) Plan
          (PBTB4), (80% weighting) and (2) Corporate-wide Sales, (20%
          weighting) objectives.  

3.2  This plan recognizes three Levels of Goal Attainment for profit and
     sales attainment:

     (a)  Target attainment which qualifies for 100% of eligible bonus.

     (b)  Threshold attainment which qualifies for 50% of eligible bonus.

     (c)  Maximum attainment which qualifies for 150% of eligible bonus.

     Target, Threshold, and Maximum goals as well as unit and corporate
     weightings are approved by the Compensation Committee.  These goals
     are attached according to your unit(s)/corporate assignment.  

3.3  Attainment levels falling between goals (i.e. Threshold Target and
     Maximum goals) will cause the award level to be adjusted by the use of
     straight-line interpolation between the appropriate levels.

3.4  Each individual eligible for this Plan has been assigned a target
     bonus percentage.  These targets are determined based on
     responsibility levels and approved by the Compensation Committee.

3.5  A participant's actual bonus for 1994 is determined by the
     participant's division head and approved by the Chief Executive
     Officer.  To assist in this determination, the division head will
     first apply the target bonus to the level of goal attainment for the
     unit(s) and/or corporate to which the participant has been assigned
     for purposes of this Plan.  Once this dollar amount has been
     determined, the division head will recommend the actual bonus to be
     paid which can vary plus or minus 25% from this calculated amount. 
     This variation is based on the division head's evaluation of the
     participant's performance during 1994 in comparison to the
     participant's responsibilities and in comparison to the other
     participants' performance in that division/unit.

3.6  Each Plan participant has been assigned to one or more units and/or
     corporate.  This assignment is expressed as a percentage (0-100%) and
     is based on the participant's position and responsibility in the
     Company.  Thus, a participant's final bonus calculation will take into
     account the sum of each assigned unit/corporate achievement multiplied
     by his/her assigned percentage in that unit(s) and/or corporate.

3.7  The formula therefore for calculating an individual's bonus is as
     follows:  Bonus equals base salary paid in 1994 multiplied by the
     eligible Target Bonus multiplied by the Level of Goal Attainment
                                    -2-
     against target goals by the unit(s)/corporate area to which a
     participant is assigned.

     Bonus = Salary X Eligible Target % X Weighted Level of Goal
     Attainment.
 
3.8  Plan Participants will have this Plan explained to them.  Information
     will be provided quarterly showing estimated progress toward the
     established goals.


                                 ARTICLE IV

                         WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.
              EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE (THREE YEAR) PLAN
                             1994 - 1996 PERIOD


                                 ARTICLE I
                         ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN

1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive (Three
     Year) Plan, as summarized herein is established by Wolverine World
     Wide, Inc. (Company) for the three year fiscal period of 1994 - 1996
     and may be continued, intact or as amended, from year to year, at the
     Company's option.

1.2  The primary purpose of the plan is to:

     a.   Encourage longer range strategic planning and not stress
          over-dependence on short-term performance which could be at the
          expense of long-term increases in stockholder value and/or
          achieving a strategic position/advantage in the marketplace.
     b.   Encourage cooperation among all the units of the Company so as to
          foster a closer and more cooperative association and sense of
          teamwork.
     c.   Encourage key management individuals to enter and continue in the
          employ of the Company.


                                 ARTICLE II
                            CONCEPT OF THE PLAN

2.1  a.   The primary concept of the plan is to establish a financial goal
          for each three year time period for the Company.  These periods
          are overlapping.  The goal needs to be both closely identified
          with the interests of the stockholders and easily understood.
     b.   The goals for all plans through 1996 are expressed in terms of
          earnings per share (E.P.S.).  The Compensation Committee has
          determined that this goal meets the objectives stated above.  The
          definition of "earnings per share," for this purpose, is the
          Company's net after tax earnings per common share of stock after
          all expenses and taxes, except for the payment of the three year
          bonus itself.











                                ARTICLE III
                           GOALS FOR 1994-96 PLAN
                            (EARNINGS PER SHARE)

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
    YEAR           THRESHOLD        TARGET          MAXIMUM
<S>                <C>            <C>             <C>
    1994            $ 1.75         $ 2.05          $ 2.46
    1995              2.00           2.35            2.83
    1996              2.34           2.70            3.25
    TOTAL           $ 6.09         $ 7.10          $ 8.54
</TABLE>

Note:  In order to pay a bonus, E.P.S. in the third year must be at least
20% of the total E.P.S. goal for the three year period (e.g. at Threshold,
E.P.S. for 1996 must be 1.22 cents per share, 20% X $6.09).

Special Note

The Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce any participant's
bonus if his/her performance was not satisfactory during any year of the
Plan and/or if his/her unit did not achieve 80% of the Unit Target Goal for
the three year period (as noted in the Executive Annual Bonus Plan) and/or
if the Chief Executive Officer recommends a reduction in an individual's
bonus.

Payout Against Goals

Payout under the 1994-96 Plan as a percentage of each participant's
individual target bonus will be made within thirty days of acceptance of
the fiscal year 1996 certified audit by the Board of Directors, according
to the final schedule: 

<TABLE>
    GOAL                          PAYOUT AS % OF TARGET BONUS*
<S>          <C>                               <C>
    Threshold $6.09                              50%
    Target    $7.10                             100%
    Maximum   $8.54                             150%
</TABLE>

*  For E.P.S. between the goals shown, the payout as a percentage of Target
Bonus will be determined by straight line interpretation.

                                 ARTICLE IV
                        TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

4.1  Retirement, Death, or Total Disability.

     If a participant ceases to be a participant before the end of any
     performance period and more than twelve months after the beginning of
     such performance period because of death, normal or early retirement
     under the Company's retirement plan, as then in effect, or total
     disability under the Company's long-term disability plan, an award
     shall be paid to him or his estate after the end of such performance
     period prorated as follows.  The award, if any, for such performance
     period shall be the amount that he would have received if he had been
     a participant during the entire performance period, multiplied by the
     ratio of his full months as a participant during that performance
     period to the number of months in that performance period.

4.2  Other Termination.

     If an employee ceases to be a participant during any performance
     period(s), or prior to actual receipt of the award for a previous
     period because of the participant's termination of employment for any
     reason other than described in Section 4.1 above, the participant will
     not be entitled to any award for such performance period.  If a
     participant continues in Wolverine's employment but no longer is
     approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to
     participate in future periods, his/her eligibility for a prorated
     award in current periods will be determined solely by the Compensation
     Committee and communicated to the employee.  Factors used in this
     determination could include the employee's past and current
     performance, reasons for the change in participation and other job
     related factors as determined by the Compensation Committee.


                                 ARTICLE V
                                  SUMMARY

This communication is meant to summarize the major elements of the
Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan.  The Plan
shall not be construed to give and does not give any employee the right to
be retained in the employ of the Company.

The Board may discontinue the Plan at any time, suspend the Plan at any
time or from time to time, and from time to time amend the Plan in any
respect, except that no amendment may be made which either would cause any
participant to be deprived of any award previously earned but not paid or
would adversely affect any award such participant might receive for any
performance period which commenced before such amendment was made.  The
Board may review at any time the Plan and its administration to determine
whether the objectives of the Plan continue to be met.  Where appropriate,
the Chief Executive Officer will recommend changes in the Plan for adoption
by the Board of Directors.

                               Exhibit 10(s)

                   SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECTOR'S FEE AGREEMENT


          THIS SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECTOR'S FEE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is
made as of April 27, 1993 by and between PHILLIP D. MATTHEWS, an individual
("Director"), and WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

                              R E C I T A L S:

          Director is an independent, non-employee director of the Company. 
Due to his unique and substantial experience in business, the Company
desires that Director serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors
for a minimum period of one year.  In connection with such service, the
Company desires that Director commit a substantial amount of his time,
efforts and attention to the affairs of the Company and make himself
regularly available for consultation with the executive officers of the
Company.  In performing such services, the Company recognizes and
anticipates that Director may be required to forego other business
opportunities and reduce or eliminate his participation in other ventures
with which he is currently involved.  Director is willing and desires to
serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors on the terms set
forth in this Agreement.

          ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:


          1.   Service as Chairman.  Director agrees to serve as Chairman
of the Company's Board of Directors during the term of this Agreement. 
Director will serve in such position as an officer of the Board of
Directors and not as an executive officer or employee of the Company.  In
connection with such service, Director agrees to assist with and supervise
the overall management of the Company as the Chairman of the Board, and to
perform such other services as the Board of Directors may reasonably
request.  Director agrees to devote such amounts of his time, efforts and
attention to the affairs of the Company as may be required in his
reasonable judgment to perform such services to the satisfaction of the
Company's Board of Directors.  Director agrees to make himself available on
a regular basis for consultation with the Company's executive officers. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall guarantee or require or compel the Company or the Board of
Directors to retain Director in the position of Chairman of the Board or
otherwise infringe upon the unfettered right of the Board of Directors to
elect or appoint any other person to the position of Chairman of the Board
of Directors.

          2.   Term; Renewal.  The term of this Agreement shall be for a
period of one year, commencing on April 27, 1993 and ending on April 26,
1994.  Unless the Company delivers written notice to the Director on or
prior to April 1, 1994, or April 1 of any succeeding year during the term
of this Agreement, of its intention not to renew the term of this Agreement
for an additional one-year period, then this Agreement shall be
automatically renewed for an additional one-year period on the same terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

          3.   Compensation.  In consideration of the extraordinary  time,
effort and attention Director has agreed to commit to the Company in
connection with such service as Chairman of the Company's Board of
Directors above and beyond the time, effort and attention expected of other
directors of the Company, the Company agrees to compensate Director as
follows:

          (a)  Retainer; Meeting Fees.  The Company shall pay to Director
     the Company's standard retainer fee for service as a member of the
     Board of Directors as in effect from time to time as and when payable
     to all directors of the Company.  The Company shall also pay to
     Director the standard fee for attendance at and participation in
     meetings of the Board of Directors as and when payable to all
     directors of the Company.  Director shall not be entitled to
     compensation for attendance at meetings of committees of the Company's
     Board of Directors.

          (b)  Additional Compensation.  The Company shall pay to Director
     a fee of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in twelve (12) equal,
     monthly installments payable on the last day of each month during the
     term of this Agreement, commencing May 31, 1993.  The final monthly
     installment for the first year of this Agreement will be paid to
     Director on April 26, 1994.

          (c)  Business Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
     Director for actual and reasonable business expenses incurred by
     Director in connection with his service as Chairman of the Company's
     Board of Directors during the term of this Agreement and, for each
     one-year term of this Agreement, will also pay directly or reimburse
     Director for office, clerical and related expenses incurred by
     Director in connection with such service in an amount not to exceed
     Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000).

          (d)  Stock Option.  The Company shall grant to Director a non-
     qualified stock option to purchase 3,000 shares of the Company's
     Common Stock, $1.00 par value (the "Option Shares").  The per share
     purchase price for the Option Shares shall be equal to the mean of the
     highest and lowest prices of sales of shares of Common Stock on the
     New York Stock Exchange on April 27, 1993.  Such option shall be
     evidenced by a written agreement containing such terms and conditions,
     consistent with this Agreement, as the members of the Compensation
     Committee of the Company's Board of Directors may determine.

          4.   Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company or by Director as follows:





                                    -2-

          (a)  Discretionary Termination by Director.  Director may
     terminate this Agreement at any time in Director's discretion, for any
     reason or without reason, upon sixty (60) days' advance written notice
     delivered to the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
     Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

          (b)  Termination by Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
     this Agreement immediately for Cause.  "Cause" shall include, without
     limitation, Director's material breach of this Agreement; the willful
     and continued failure to perform his duties as provided in this
     Agreement; misappropriation of Company property; activities in aid of
     a competitor; dishonesty; conviction of a crime involving moral
     turpitude injurious to the Company; or removal from office by the
     stockholders of the Company as provided in the Delaware General
     Corporation Law, as such law may be amended.

          (c)  Termination by Non-renewal.  This Agreement will
     automatically terminate at the end of any one-year Agreement term if
     the Company has provided the Director with the notice of non-renewal
     specified in Section 2 above.

          (d)  Discretionary Termination by Company.  The Company may
     terminate this Agreement at any time in its discretion, for any reason
     or without reason.  Any termination of this Agreement by the Company,
     other than termination for Cause or by non-renewal, shall be deemed to
     have been a termination under this subsection.

          5.   Compensation Upon Termination.  The date on which any
termination becomes effective is referenced in this Agreement as the
"Termination Date."  Upon any termination of this Agreement, Director shall
be entitled to continue to receive the standard retainer fee and regular
fees for attendance at meetings of the Board, plus additional fees for
attendance at meetings of Board committees held after the Termination Date,
if Director continues to be a director of the Company.  In addition,
Director shall be entitled to receive the compensation set forth below:

          (a) If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(a) or
     4(b) above, Director shall be entitled to receive the additional
     compensation provided in Section 3(b) of this Agreement earned by
     Director through the Termination Date, prorated on the basis of a 365
     day year, and reimbursement pursuant to Section 3(c) of all expenses
     incurred through the Termination Date.

          (b)  If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d)
     above, except as provided in Section 6 below, Director shall be
     entitled to receive the full amount of the additional compensation
     provided in Section 3(b) of this Agreement, and reimbursement pursuant
     to Section 3(c) of all expenses incurred through the Termination Date.





                                    -3-

          6.   Termination Following Change in Control.  If this Agreement
is terminated by the Company pursuant to Sections 4(c) or 4(d) following a
Change in Control (as hereafter defined), Director shall be entitled to
receive a lump sum payment in cash on the Termination Date of Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000).  Director shall be entitled to receive the
compensation provided in Section 3(b) prorated through the date he receives
the lump sum payment provided above, and shall not be entitled to any
compensation provided in Section 3(b) for the remaining term of this
Agreement from and after such date.  For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Change in Control" shall mean any change in control of the Company of a
nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of
Schedule 14A issued under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934
Act"); provided, that without limitation a Change in Control shall have
occurred for purposes of this Agreement if: (i) any "person" (as such term
is defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act) is or becomes
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power
of the Company's then-outstanding securities; or (ii) during any period of

                            RETIREMENT AGREEMENT


          THIS is a RETIREMENT AGREEMENT entered into between WOLVERINE
WORLD WIDE, INC. ("Company") and PETER D. PANTER ("Panter").

                                  RECITALS

          Panter has served the Company as an executive officer for many
years and has decided to voluntarily retire from the Company to pursue
other interests.  The Company desires to retain Panter as a key employee
prior to his retirement, and the parties desire to set forth their
agreement as to the terms and conditions of such retirement.  In addition,
the Company desires to protect itself against any potential competitive
activities by Panter, and Panter desires to accept such restrictions upon
competitive activities, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     Section 1.  Retirement From Employment.  Panter will voluntarily
retire from the Company's employ effective 12:01 a.m., December 31, 1993
("Retirement Date").  Except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, all
of his employment duties, obligations, and authorities shall cease
effective that date.  Panter will also resign from any and all offices
which he holds with the Company and any of its subsidiaries or other
affiliates effective on the Retirement Date.

     Section 2.  Termination of Prior Employment Agreements; Continued
Employment At-Will.

          (a)  Termination of Employment Agreements.  Any and all of
     Panter's prior employment agreements with the Company, including
     but not limited to that agreement dated as of October 20, 1992,
     and signed by him on April 22, 1993, are hereby terminated and
     canceled and are of no further force or effect.  Any rights
     arising out said prior agreements are hereby extinguished.

          (b)  Employment Pending Retirement.  Until the Retirement
     Date and unless earlier terminated in accordance with this
     Agreement, Panter shall continue to receive the same base
     compensation (i.e. $175,000 per year or $14,583.33 per month) and
     automobile allowance ($5,616 per year or $468 per month) which he
     has been receiving prior to the effective date of this Agreement. 
     During such time, Panter shall continue to be extended by the
     Company the same health, life, and disability insurance benefits
     he received prior to July 1, 1993.  Panter will be advised in
     writing on or after his Retirement Date, or such earlier
     termination date as may occur per this Agreement, of his right
     pursuant to the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget
     Reconstruction Act, to thereafter continue certain health
     insurance coverages at his expense.  

          (c)  Employment At-Will.  Panter's continued employment
     prior to his Retirement Date shall be "at-will."  Either Panter

     or the Company may in their sole respective discretion terminate
     the employment relationship at any time prior to the Retirement
     Date, with or without cause, and with or without prior notice or
     warning.  If Panter is terminated by the Company without cause
     prior to his Retirement Date, he shall continue to receive until
     the Retirement Date the salary and benefits set forth in Section
     2(b).  If Panter's employment with the Company should be
     terminated prior to the Retirement Date for any reason other than
     termination by the Company without cause, including his
     resignation of employment with the Company prior to the
     Retirement Date, or if he is terminated by the Company for cause
     prior to that date, all Company obligations to continue paying
     his salary and furnishing benefits to him per this section shall
     thereupon immediately cease.

     Section 3.  Duties.  Panter's duties between the date of this
Agreement and his Retirement Date shall be those of a general managerial
nature as may be reasonably assigned to him by the Company's Chief
Executive Officer, or such other officer as the Chief Executive Officer may
designate.  

     Section 4.  Future Communications.  Third parties who inquire of the
Company as to Panter's  employment/separation from employment will be
advised of: the dates of his employment; his title and duties at the time
of his retirement; and that, having reached the Company's normal retirement
age, Mr. Panter chose to retire effective December 31, 1993.  Panter shall
not, from and after the date of this Agreement, voice criticisms of the
Company, its management or its operation in any conversation,
correspondence or other communications with any person or entity including,
without limitation, employees of the Company, its customers, or with the
general public.  Panter understands and agrees that this commitment is an
express condition of the Company's commitments in this Retirement
Agreement, and that the Company shall be entitled to cease making any
payments herein required in the event that Panter should fail to adhere to
this provision.  Failure by Panter to adhere to this provision shall also
entitle the Company to recover from Panter all payments made to him in
accordance with this Agreement, together with legal fees and other costs
reasonably incurred by the Company in effecting such recovery.

     Section 5.  Deferred Compensation Agreement.  Panter's Deferred
Compensation Agreement of September 27, 1989, with the Company will
continue in effect in accordance with its terms.  The Company waives any
right which it might have, based upon information disclosed by Panter to
the Company's Chief Executive Officer prior to July 1, 1993, to discharge
Panter for dishonesty or for any action inimical and injurious to the
interests of the Company.  The foregoing waiver does not apply with respect
to any discharge decision motivated by any information brought to the
attention of the Company's Chief Executive Officer on or after the date of
this Retirement Agreement.  If Panter is discharged prior to his Retirement
Date, the effect of such discharge on his eligibility for deferred



                                    -2-
compensation per the September 27, 1989, Deferred Compensation Agreement
will be determined in accordance with that Agreement's terms.  The 180
month period during which Panter will receive deferred compensation
payments pursuant to paragraph "2" of his September 27, 1989, Deferred
Compensation Agreement shall begin with the payment to be mailed to Panter
on or about January 1, 1994.

     Section 6.  Stock Option Plans Participation.  The parties recognize
that prior to July 1, 1993, Panter has been a participant in the Company's
1988 Stock Option Plan ("1988 Plan") and the 1984 Executive Incentive Stock
Purchase Plan ("1984 Plan").  Panter has, prior to July 1, 1993, received
vested rights to purchase Company stock pursuant to said plan(s), which
rights are summarized on Schedule "A" attached to this Agreement.  The
purchase rights summarized on Schedule "A" are not affected by this
Agreement.  Panter hereby waives any and all rights which he may have or
assert with respect to stock options which have not vested in him prior to
July 1, 1993, or to restricted stock on which restrictions have not lapsed
as of July 1, 1993,including any such rights which would otherwise result
from Panter's employment between July 1, 1993, and his Retirement Date. 
The Company's Compensation Committee shall, in its sole discretion and
after the Retirement Date but before January 31, 1994, determine whether or
not to accelerate vesting of any stock options issued pursuant to the 1988
Plan but not vested in Panter prior to July 1, 1993, and/or whether to
cancel the restrictions on any outstanding restricted shares issued
pursuant to the 1984 Plan.

     Section 7.  Bonus Plans Participation to be Discretionary With
Company.  The parties recognize that as of July 1, 1993, Panter had
participated in the Company's "Wolverine World Wide, Inc., Executive Long-
Term Incentive (Three Year) Plan" for the 1991-1993, 1992-1994, and 1993-
1995 periods and the "Wolverine World Wide, Inc., Executive Short-Term
Incentive Plan" for 1993 (collectively, the "Bonus Plans"). 
Notwithstanding any provision of said Plans to the contrary, Panter shall
be entitled to participate in and receive any payments in respect of the
Bonus Plans with respect to fiscal 1993 and the three year periods
referenced above only to the extent that the Company's Chief Executive
Officer shall, in his sole discretion, determine such participation and/or
payments to be appropriate.  Panter specifically waives any and all claims
which he might have pursuant to the Bonus Plans for any payments which
might otherwise be owed to him based upon Company earnings during these
Plan periods.

     Section 8.  Pension Plan.  The parties recognize that Panter has prior
to July 1, 1993, participated in the "Wolverine World Wide Employee Pension
Plan" ("Pension Plan").  Panter's rights pursuant to said plan are
unaffected by this Agreement.  The waiver and release set forth in Section
15 of this Agreement do not apply with respect to such vested interests
Panter may have pursuant to that Pension Plan.  Panter's employment between
July 1, 1993, and his Retirement Date (or such earlier date of termination




                                    -3-
as may occur) shall constitute "credited service" for purposes of computing
benefits to which Panter is entitled pursuant to the Pension Plan.

     Section 9.  Adjustment of Future Advances.  The Company will deduct
from the final pay check(s) owed to Panter per section 2(b) above any
business expense reimbursement which has been advanced to Panter prior to
December 31, 1993, but with respect to which proper documentation has not
been furnished by him prior to that date.

     Section 10.  Cash Value of Life Insurance Policy.  The Company
currently maintains a whole life insurance policy upon the life of Panter. 
The Company shall maintain that policy in effect through Panter's
Retirement Date, or through the date of such earlier termination of Panter
as may occur per this Agreement.  At that time, the cash surrender value of
this life insurance policy shall become the property of Panter.  The
parties will cooperate in the completion of all forms necessary to
implement the foregoing.

     Section 11.  Covenants/Confidential Information. 

          (a)  Covenants Not to Compete.  Panter agrees that, prior to
     January 1, 1999, he will not, without the prior written consent
     of the Company: (i) solicit any customer and/or licensee of the
     Company regarding products offered by the Company; (ii) compete,
     directly or indirectly, with the Company in any line of business
     engaged in by the Company if in the normal course of that
     business Panter would directly or indirectly solicit or service
     customers and/or licensees of the Company; (iii) consult with or
     assist in any way any entity or person which competes with the
     Company in the manner described in this paragraph; (iv) attempt
     to divert or otherwise interfere with the relationship between
     the Company and any of its customers, potential customers, and/or
     licensees which were being actively pursued by the Company during
     Panter's employment with the Company, or (v) engage, directly or
     indirectly, for the benefit of Panter or any other person or
     entity, in any activity of employment in the performance of which
     it could be reasonably anticipated that Panter would be required
     or expected to use or disclose Confidential Information obtained
     during the course of Panter's employment by the Company.  This
     covenant shall apply world-wide.  

          (b)  Employees.  Panter agrees that he will not prior to
     January 1, 1999, solicit or otherwise attempt to induce any
     employee of the Company to terminate employment with the Company. 


          (c)  Confidential Information.  Panter shall not hereafter
     use for personal benefit or other's benefit, or disclose to
     anyone, any proprietary, secret, or confidential information of
     the Company.  "Confidential Information" includes technical data,



                                    -4-
     methods, processes, software, compositions, equipment, research
     data, marketing and sales information, personnel data, customer
     lists, lists of or data respecting any Company distributors,
     franchisees, or sales representatives, agents or employees, or
     any books, records, reports, statements, financial and other
     data, or plans and all the other know-how and trade secrets
     pertaining in any respect to the Company or the Company's
     customers.

          (d)  Remedies.  Panter acknowledges that his foregoing
     confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicitation covenants are
     central to this Agreement.  Panter accordingly recognizes and
     agrees that, in the event of any breach by him of said covenants,
     the Company shall be entitled to: reimbursement to it by Panter
     of any payments made to or on behalf of Panter in accordance with
     this Agreement; cease any payments which would thereafter be due
     to Panter in accordance with this Agreement; Michigan or Federal
     court injunctive relief restraining Panter from further such
     violation of this Agreement; money damages equal to profits lost
     by the Company as a result of such breach by Panter and
     reimbursement of court costs and attorney fees and costs
     reasonably incurred by the Company in securing Panter's
     compliance with this Agreement.

     Section 12.  Interpretation by Court.  If any provision of this
Agreement as applied to any party or to any circumstance shall be adjudged
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement, the
application of such provision in any other circumstances, or the validity
or enforceability of this Agreement.  The parties agree that the provisions
hereof are reasonable and intend this Agreement to be enforced as written. 
However, if any provision, or part thereof is held to be unenforceable
because of the duration thereof, the area covered thereby, or the types of
activities restricted thereby, all parties agree that a Court of competent
jurisdiction making such determination shall have and should exercise the
power to: reduce the duration and/or area of such provision or types of
activities restricted to the maximum duration and/or area permitted by
applicable law; to delete specific words or phrases; and to enforce such
provision in its reduced form.

     Section 13.  Return of Company Property.  Panter shall on his
Retirement Date, or such earlier termination date as might occur per this
Agreement, return to the Company all of its property in his possession,
including, but not limited to, keys, office equipment, files,
correspondence, customer lists, business notes, documents and all other
materials relating to the Company's business.  Panter agrees not to keep
photocopies or other facsimiles of such materials.

     Section 14.  Waiver and Release.  Panter hereby waives and releases,
and discharges the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their



                                    -5-
officers, directors, agents, employees, and representatives from any and
all claims which Panter may have arising out of his employment or severance
of employment with the Company.  Panter accepts said consideration in full
satisfaction of all such claims, including administrative claims, charges
or complaints.  Said claims waived, released and discharged include, but
are not limited to, any administrative or civil claims arising under
Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Michigan's Handicappers' Civil
Rights Act, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act as amended in 1990, or any other state or
federal protective statutes or administrative rulings or any Michigan or
federal court rulings relating to the reasonableness, fairness, just cause
of or consistent application of the employer's policies relative to the
severance of Panter's employment.

     Section 15.  Opportunity For Review and Consultation.  Panter
acknowledges having read this Agreement and understands all of its
provisions.  Panter knowingly and voluntarily agrees to all of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement.  Panter acknowledges that he has been
deliberating whether to sign this Agreement since July 28, 1993, that he
has until 12 Noon September 13, 1993, to consider whether to enter into
this Agreement and that the period of time between those dates has provided
him a reasonable period of time for his deliberations.  Panter is hereby
encouraged by the Company to consult with an attorney regarding this
Agreement, and has done so.

     Section 16.  Revocation Period.  For a period of seven (7) calendar
days after Panter's execution of this Agreement, Panter may revoke this
Agreement by giving written notice to the Company of his decision to do so. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until this
revocation period has expired without Panter having revoked his Agreement
hereto. 

     Section 17.  Notices.  Any and all notices referred to herein shall be
sufficient if furnished in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given if mailed by certified or registered mail (postage prepaid) or
