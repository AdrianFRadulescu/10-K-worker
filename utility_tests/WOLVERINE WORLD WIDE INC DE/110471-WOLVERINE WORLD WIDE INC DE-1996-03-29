                                  PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

    Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading designer,
manufacturer and marketer of a broad line of quality comfortable casual
shoes, rugged outdoor and work footwear, and constructed slippers and
moccasins.  The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor of a 1969
reorganization of a Michigan corporation of the same name, originally
organized in 1906, which in turn was the successor of a footwear business
established in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1883.

    Consumers on six continents purchased approximately 29.8 million pairs
of Company branded footwear during fiscal 1995, making the Company a
global leader among U.S. shoe companies in the marketing of branded
non-athletic footwear.  The Company's products generally feature contemporary
styling with patented technologies designed to provide maximum comfort.  The
products are marketed throughout the world under widely recognized brand
names, including HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED], WOLVERINE[REGISTERED],
BATES[REGISTERED], CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] and COLEMAN[REGISTERED].  The
Company believes that its primary competitive strengths are its well
recognized brand names, broad range of comfortable footwear, patented
comfort technologies, distribution through numerous channels and
diversified manufacturing and sourcing base.

    The Company's footwear is sold under a variety of brand names designed
to appeal to most consumers of non-athletic footwear at numerous price
points.  The Company's footwear products are organized under three
operating divisions: (i) The Hush Puppies Company, focusing on comfortable
casual shoes, (ii) the Wolverine Footwear Group, focusing on work, outdoor
and lifestyle boots and shoes and (iii) the Tru-Stitch Footwear Division,
focusing on slippers and moccasins under private labels for third party
retailers.  The Company's Global Operations Group is responsible for
manufacturing and sourcing, including the operation of the Company-owned
pigskin tannery.  The Company's footwear is distributed domestically to
approximately 30,000 department store, footwear chain, catalog specialty
retailer and mass merchant accounts, as well as 58 Company-owned retail
stores.  The Company's products are distributed worldwide through
approximately 150 licensees and distributors in over 90 countries.
Footwear has accounted for 90% or more of the consolidated revenues of the
Company for each of the last three years.  For further financial
information regarding the Company, see the consolidated financial
statements of the Company, which are attached as Appendix A to this Form
10-K.

    On March 22, 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of certain
assets of Hy-Test, Inc. ("Hy-Test") from The Florsheim Shoe Company.  The
acquisition includes various assets of the Hy-Test work, safety and

                       -1-
occupational footwear business.  The Hy-Test business will be operated as
part of the Wolverine Footwear Group.

    The Company, through its Wolverine Leathers Division, is one of the
premier tanners of quality pigskin leather for the shoe and leather goods
industries.  The pigskin leather tanned by the Company is used in a
significant portion of the footwear manufactured and sold by the Company,
and is also sold to other domestic and foreign manufacturers of shoes.

PRODUCTS.

    The Company's product offerings include casual, dress, work and
uniform shoes, and work, sport and uniform boots as well as constructed
slippers and moccasins.  Footwear is offered by the Company under many
recognizable brand names including HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED],
WOLVERINE[REGISTERED], BATES[REGISTERED], CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] and
COLEMAN[REGISTERED].  The Company also manufactures constructed slippers
and moccasins and markets them on a private label basis through its Tru-Stitch
Footwear Division.  Through its manufacturing facilities and third-party
contractors, the Company combines quality materials and skilled
workmanship from around the world to produce footwear according to its
specifications.

    THE HUSH PUPPIES COMPANY.  The Company believes that HUSH
PUPPIES'[REGISTERED] 38-year heritage as a pioneer of comfortable casual
shoes positions the brand to capitalize on the global trend toward more
casual workplace and leisure attire.  The diverse product line includes
numerous styles for both work and casual wear, utilizes comfort features,
such as the COMFORT CURVE[REGISTERED] sole and patented BOUNCE[REGISTERED]
technology, and is marketed under the advertising theme "We Invented
Casual<Trademark>."  HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED] shoes are sold to men,
women and children in over 70 countries and are distributed through
a multi-tiered network of department stores, specialty retailers, 
catalogs and Company-owned stores.

    THE WOLVERINE FOOTWEAR GROUP.  The Wolverine Footwear Group is one of
the world's largest work and outdoor footwear companies, encompassing
multiple brands designed with performance and comfort features to serve a
variety of work, outdoor and lifestyle functions.  The
WOLVERINE[REGISTERED] brand, which has been in existence for 112 years, is
identified with performance and quality and includes products bearing the
names WOLVERINE[REGISTERED], WOLVERINE WILDERNESS[REGISTERED] and WOLVERINE
SPORTSMAN<Trademark>.  The Wolverine Footwear Group also includes the
BATES[REGISTERED], CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED], COLEMAN[REGISTERED] and
HY-TEST[REGISTERED] product lines.  The product lines feature patented
technologies and designs, such as the DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] and HIDDEN
TRACKS<Trademark> systems, and the use of quality materials and components.

    WOLVERINE BOOTS AND SHOES.  The Company believes the
WOLVERINE[REGISTERED] brand has built its reputation by making quality,

                       -2-
durable and comfortable work boots and shoes.  The development of
DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] technology allowed the WOLVERINE[REGISTERED] brand
to introduce a broad line of work footwear with a focus on comfort. 
WOLVERINE[REGISTERED] brand work boots and shoes, including steel toes,
target male and female industrial and farm workers and are distributed
through department stores and specialty and independent retailers.

    WOLVERINE WILDERNESS.  The WOLVERINE WILDERNESS[REGISTERED] line
introduced DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] technology and other comfort features to
products designed for rugged outdoor use.  This broad product line includes
all-terrain sport boots, walking shoes, trail hikers, rugged casuals and
outdoor sandals.  The line targets active lifestyles and is distributed
through department stores and specialty and independent retailers.

    WOLVERINE SPORTSMAN.  The Company's WOLVERINE SPORTSMAN<Trademark>
boots target hunters, fishermen and other active outdoor users.  Warmth,
waterproofing and comfort are achieved through the use of GORTEX[REGISTERED],
THINSULATE[REGISTERED] and the Company's DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] brand
technologies.  The WOLVERINE SPORTSMAN<Trademark> line is sold through
specialty retail and catalog distribution channels that serve hunting
and fishing enthusiasts.

    BATES.  The Company's Bates Division is an industry leader in
supplying footwear to military and civilian uniform users.  The Bates
Division utilizes DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] and other proprietary comfort
technologies in the design of its military-style boots and oxfords. 
Civilian uniform uses include police, postal, restaurant and other
industrial occupations.  Bates Division products are also distributed
through specialty retailers and catalogs.

    CATERPILLAR.  The Company has been granted the exclusive worldwide
rights to manufacture, market and distribute certain footwear and related
accessories under the CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED], CAT DESIGN[REGISTERED] and
other trademarks.  The Company believes the association with
CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] equipment enhances the reputation of its boots for
quality, ruggedness and durability.  The diversity of the product line and
strong recognition of the CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] brand name allow the
Company to distribute products through a wide variety of channels,
including mass merchants, department stores and independent retailers. 
These products are primarily targeted at work and industrial users.

    COLEMAN.  The Company has been granted the exclusive rights to
manufacture, market, distribute and sell certain outdoor footwear under the
COLEMAN[REGISTERED] brand in the United States, Japan and Canada. 
COLEMAN[REGISTERED] brand footwear products include lightweight hiking
boots, rubber footgear and outdoor sandals, which are sold primarily at
value-oriented prices through mass merchants.

    HY-TEST.  On March 22, 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of
certain assets of the Hy-Test work, safety and occupational footwear

                       -3-
business from The Florsheim Shoe Company.  The HY-TEST[REGISTERED] product
line consists primarily of high quality work boots and shoes.
HY-TEST[REGISTERED] brand footwear is sold to male and female industrial
workers, primarily through a network of independent shoemobile
distributors.

    THE TRU-STITCH FOOTWEAR DIVISION.  Through the Tru-Stitch Footwear
Division, the Company is the leading supplier of constructed slippers in
the United States.

    The styling of TRU-STITCH[REGISTERED] footwear reflects consumer
demand for the "rugged indoor" look by using natural leathers such as
moosehide, shearling and suede in constructed slipper and indoor and
outdoor moccasin designs.  The Company designs and manufactures constructed
slippers and moccasins on a private label basis according to customer
specifications.  Such products are manufactured for leading United States
retailers and catalogs, such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, L.L. Bean, Eddie
Bauer and Lands' End.

    THE WOLVERINE LEATHERS DIVISION.  The Company's Global Operations
Group includes the Wolverine Leathers Division, the largest domestic tanner
of pigskin, primarily for use in the footwear industry.

    WOLVERINE LEATHERS[REGISTERED] brand products are manufactured in the
Company's pigskin tannery located in Rockford, Michigan.  The Company
believes these leathers offer superior performance and cost advantages over
cowhide leathers.  The Company's waterproof, stain resistant and washable
leathers are featured in all of the Company's domestic footwear lines and
many products offered by the Company's international licensees.

MARKETING.

    The Company's overall marketing strategy is to develop brand-specific
plans and related promotional materials for the United States market which
foster a differentiated and globally consistent image for each of the
Company's core brands.  Each brand group within the Company has its own
marketing personnel who develop the marketing strategy for products within
that group.  Domestic marketing campaigns target both the Company's retail
accounts and consumers, and strive to increase overall brand awareness for
the Company's products.  The Company's advertisements typically emphasize
the comfort and quality of its footwear, in addition to durability,
functionality and other performance aspects.  Components of the brand-specific
plans include print, radio and television advertising, in-store
point of purchase displays, Shop-in-Shop design, promotional materials, and
sales and technical floor assistance.

    The Company's brand groups provide its international licensees and
distributors with creative direction and materials to convey consistent
messages and brand images.  Examples of assistance provided by the Company
to its licensees and distributors are (i) direction concerning the

                       -4-
categories of footwear to be promoted, (ii) photography and layouts, (iii)
broadcast advertising, including commercials and film footage, (iv) point
of purchase presentation specifications and blueprints, (v) sales
materials, and (vi) consulting concerning retail store layout and design. 
The Company believes the strengths of its brand names provide a competitive
advantage.  In support of this belief, the Company has significantly
increased its expenditures on marketing and promotion to support the
position of its products and enhance brand awareness.

DOMESTIC SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

    The Company uses a wide variety of distribution channels to distribute
its products.  To meet the diverse needs of its broad customer base, the
Company uses three primary distribution strategies.

     -   Traditional wholesale distribution is used to service department
         stores (such as J.C. Penney, Sears and Nordstrom), large footwear
         chains (such as Famous Footwear and Chernin's), specialty
         retailers, catalogs and independent retailers.  A dedicated sales
         force and customer service team, advertising and point of
         purchase support and in-stock inventories are used to service
         these accounts.

     -   Volume direct programs provide branded and private label footwear
         at competitive prices with limited marketing support.  These
         programs service major retail, mail order and government
         customers.

     -   First cost agreements are primarily utilized to furnish brands
         licensed by the Company to mass merchants (such as Wal-Mart) on a
         royalty basis.

    In connection with the March 22, 1996, acquisition of the Hy-Test business,
the Company plans to distribute and sell HY-TEST[REGISTERED] brand products
primarily through an established network of independent shoemobile
distributors.  The Company may also distribute additional products through
this independent distributor network.

    In addition to its wholesale activities, the Company operated 58
domestic retail shoe stores as of March 22, 1996, under two formats,
consisting of factory outlet stores and mall-based speciality stores.  In
fiscal 1990, the Company implemented a strategic plan to focus the majority
of its resources on its wholesale businesses.  As a result, the Company's
retail operations were significantly downsized and repositioned from 176
stores operating under seven formats in 1990 to the current store base. 
The Company expects the scope of its retail operations to remain relatively
consistent in the foreseeable future.  Most of the Company's 49 factory
outlet stores carry a large selection of first quality Company branded
footwear at a discount to conventional retail prices.  The 9 regional mall-based
full service, full price HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED] Specialty Stores

                       -5-
feature a broad selection of men's and women's HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED]
brand footwear and are used by the Company to test new styles and
merchandizing strategies.  The Company also adopted a plan in 1994 to
discontinue its operation of leased shoe departments in the Lamonts Apparel
chain and completed the plan in July 1995.

    A broad distribution base insulates the Company from dependence on any
one customer.  No customer of the Company accounted for more than 10% of
the Company's net sales and other operating income in fiscal 1995.

    Retail footwear sales are seasonal with significant increases in sales
experienced during the Christmas, Easter and back-to-school periods.  Due
to this seasonal nature of footwear sales, the Company experiences some
fluctuation in the levels of working capital.  The Company provides working
capital for such fluctuations through internal financing and through a
revolving credit agreement that the Company has in place.  The Company
expects the seasonal sales pattern to continue in future years.

GLOBAL LICENSING.

    The Company derives royalty income from licensing the HUSH
PUPPIES[REGISTERED], WOLVERINE[REGISTERED], WOLVERINE
WILDERNESS[REGISTERED], and other trademarks to domestic and foreign
licensees for use on footwear and related products.  The Company, as a
licensee, sells footwear bearing the CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] and
COLEMAN[REGISTERED] trademarks through foreign distributors.  Licensing and
distributing enables the Company to develop international markets without
the capital commitment required to maintain inventories or fund localized
marketing programs.  In fiscal 1995, the Company's foreign licensees and
distributors sold an estimated 14.3 million pairs of footwear, an increase
from approximately 11.5 million pairs sold in fiscal 1994.

    The Company continues to develop a global network of licensees and
distributors to market its footwear brands.  The Company assists in
designing products that are appropriate to each foreign market but are
consistent with the global brand position.  The licensees and distributors
then either manufacture their own product or purchase goods from either the
Company or third-party manufacturers.  Each licensee and distributor is
responsible for the marketing and distribution of the Company's products.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING.

    Although approximately one half of the Company's product line is
purchased or sourced from third parties, the remainder is produced at
Company-owned facilities.  The Company's footwear is manufactured in
several domestic and certain related foreign facilities located in
Michigan, Arkansas, New York, the Caribbean Basin and Canada.  In addition,
in connection with the acquisition of the Hy-Test business, the Company acquired
a 104,000 square foot shoe factory in Kirksville, Missouri.  The Company has
implemented a "twin plant" concept whereby the labor intensive cutting and

                       -6-
fitting construction of the "upper" is performed at the Company's
facilities in the Caribbean Basin and the technology intensive
construction, or "bottoming," is performed at the Company's domestic
facilities.

    The Company has retooled most of its factories since the beginning of
fiscal 1993, giving each facility the flexibility to produce a variety of
footwear, and has departed from the industry's historic practice of
dedicating a given facility for production of specific footwear products. 
The traditional dedication of facilities at times caused internal conflicts
in manufacturing capacity and did not permit the Company to quickly respond
to changes in market preference and demand.  The Company now produces
various products for both men and women in most of its domestic facilities,
providing greater flexibility for the Company to respond to both market and
customer-specific demand.

    The Company sources certain footwear from a variety of foreign
manufacturing facilities in the Asia-Pacific region, Central and South
America and Europe.  The Company maintains technical offices in the Asia-
Pacific region to facilitate the sourcing and importation of quality
footwear.  The Company has established guidelines for each of its third-
party manufacturers in order to monitor product quality, labor practices,
and financial viability.

    The Company's domestic manufacturing operations allow the Company to
(i) reduce its lead time, enabling it to quickly respond to market demand
and reduce inventory risk, (ii) lower freight and shipping costs and (iii)
closely monitor product quality.  The Company's foreign manufacturing
strategy allows the Company to (i) benefit from lower labor costs, (ii)
source the highest quality raw materials from around the world and (iii)
avoid additional capital expenditures necessary for factories and
equipment.  The Company believes that its overall global manufacturing
strategy gives the Company maximum flexibility to properly balance the need
for timely shipments, high quality products and competitive pricing.

    The Company owns and operates a pigskin tannery, which is one of the
premier tanners of quality leather for the footwear industry.  The Company
and its licensees receive virtually all of their pigskin requirements from
the tannery.  The Company believes the tannery provides a strategic
advantage for the Company by producing leather using proprietary technology
at prices below those available from other sources.  The continued
operation of this tannery is important to the Company's competitive
position in the footwear industry.

    The Company's principal required raw material is quality leather,
which it purchases primarily from a select group of domestic suppliers,
including the Company's tannery.  The global availability of shearling and
cowhide leather eliminates any reliance by the Company upon a sole
supplier.  However, the Company currently purchases the vast majority of
the raw pigskins used in a significant portion of its tannery operations from

                       -7-
a single domestic source, which has been a reliable and consistent supplier
for over 30 years.  The Company purchases all of its other raw materials
and component parts from a variety of sources, none of which is believed by
the Company to be a dominant supplier.

    The Company is subject to the normal risks of doing business abroad
due to its international operations, including the risk of expropriation,
acts of war, political disturbances and similar events, and loss of most
favored nations trading status.  With respect to international sourcing
activities, management believes that over a period of time, it could
arrange adequate alternative sources of supply for the products currently
obtained from its foreign suppliers.  A sustained disruption of such
sources of supply could, particularly on a short-term basis, have an
adverse impact on the Company's operations.

TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND PATENTS.

    The Company holds a number of registered and common law trademarks
that identify its products.  The trademarks that are most widely used by
the Company include HUSH PUPPIES[REGISTERED], WOLVERINE[REGISTERED],
WOLVERINE WILDERNESS AND SUN DESIGN[REGISTERED], BATES[REGISTERED],
DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED], BOUNCE AND DESIGN[REGISTERED], COMFORT
CURVE[REGISTERED], TRU-STITCH[REGISTERED], and SIOUX MOX[REGISTERED].  The
Company is licensed to market certain footwear under the
COLEMAN[REGISTERED] trademark in the United States and Canada and in Japan
pursuant to agreements extending through December 31, 2000, and June 30,
1999, respectively.  The Company is also licensed to market certain
footwear throughout the world under the CATERPILLAR[REGISTERED] and CAT
DESIGN[REGISTERED] trademarks pursuant to an agreement that extends through
December 31, 1999.  Pigskin leather produced by the Company is sold under
the trademarks WOLVERINE LEATHERS[REGISTERED], ALL WEATHER LEATHERS<Trademark>
and SATIN SUEDE<Trademark>.  In addition, with the acquisition of the Hy-Test
business, the Company acquired the HY-TEST[REGISTERED] and other trademarks.

    The Company believes that its products are identified by consumers by
its trademarks and that its trademarks are valuable assets.  The Company is
not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of its
trademarks that could materially affect its current business.  It is the
policy of the Company to pursue registration of its primary marks whenever
possible and to vigorously defend its trademarks against infringement or
other threats to the greatest extent practicable under the laws of the
United States and other countries.  The Company is also the holder of
several patents, copyrights and various other proprietary rights.  The
Company protects all of its proprietary rights to the greatest extent
practicable under applicable law.

ORDER BACKLOG.

    At March 1, 1996, the Company had a backlog of orders of approximately
$107 million compared with a backlog of approximately $87 million at March 1,

                       -8-
1995.  While orders in backlog are subject to cancellation by customers,
the Company has not experienced significant cancellation of orders in the
past and the Company expects that substantially all of the orders will be
shipped in fiscal 1996.  The backlog at a particular time is affected by a
number of factors, including seasonality and the scheduling of the
manufacture and shipment of products.  Accordingly, a comparison of backlog
from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be
indicative of eventual actual shipments.

COMPETITION.

    The Company's footwear lines are manufactured and marketed in a highly
competitive environment.  The Company competes with numerous manufacturers
(domestic and foreign) and importers of footwear, some of which are larger
and have greater resources than the Company.  The Company's major
competitors for its brands of footwear are located in the United States.
The Company has at least ten major competitors in connection with the
sale of its work shoes and boots, at least eight major competitors in
connection with the sale of its sport boots, and at least fifteen major
competitors in connection with the sale of its casual and dress shoes. 
Product performance and quality, including technological improvements,
product identity, competitive pricing, and the ability to adapt to style
changes are all important elements of competition in the footwear markets
served by the Company.  The footwear industry in general is subject to
changes in consumer preferences.  The Company strives to meet competition
and maintain its competitive position through promotion of brand awareness,
manufacturing efficiencies, its tannery operations, and the style, comfort
and value of its products.  Future sales by the Company will be affected by
its continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to
meet shifts in consumer preference.

    Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company is
unable to state with certainty its position in the footwear industry.  The
market share in the footwear industry is highly fragmented and no one
company has a dominant market position; however, the Company believes it is one
of the three largest domestic manufacturers of footwear.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

    In addition to normal and recurring product development, design and
styling activities, the Company engages in research and development related
to new and improved materials for use in its footwear and other products
and in the development and adaptation of new production techniques.  The
Company's continuing relationship with the Biomechanics Evaluation
Laboratory at Michigan State University has led to specific biomechanical design
concepts, such as BOUNCE[REGISTERED], DURASHOCKS[REGISTERED] and HIDDEN
TRACKS<Trademark> comfort technologies, that have been incorporated in the
Company's footwear.  The Company also maintains a footwear design center in
Italy to develop contemporary styling for the Company and its international
licensees. 

                       -9-
While the Company continues to be a leading developer of footwear
innovations, research and development costs do not represent a material
portion of operating expenses.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

    Compliance with federal, state and local regulations with respect to
the environment has not had, nor is it expected to have, any material
effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the
Company.  The Company uses and generates, and in the past has used and
generated, certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be
deemed hazardous under certain federal, state and local regulations with
respect to the environment.  The Company from time to time works with
federal, state and local agencies to resolve cleanup issues at various
waste sites or other regulatory issues.

     The Company is one of 14 companies presently identified as potentially
responsible parties ("PRPs") by the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality ("MDEQ") at the Sunrise Landfill Site near Wayland, Michigan.  The
MDEQ has demanded that the PRPs pay approximately $3.7 million as
reimbursement for past costs of excavating drums of hazardous waste at the
site and join in financing further investigation and remedial efforts. It
is too early to accurately estimate the cost of completing the cleanup of
the site, but it could exceed $15 million.  Preliminary test results
suggest that it may be possible to leave the remaining drums in place,
thereby significantly reducing the costs of remediation.  In August 1994,
the PRPs, including the Company, entered into a consent agreement with the
MDEQ in which they agreed to collectively pay $323,000 in costs incurred by
the MDEQ prior to July 1991, to investigate possible responses, and to
implement interim measures to control current and prevent future
environmental degradation.  The Company's share of the investigative and
interim response activity costs, approximately $90,000, has already been
fully paid.

     In October, 1995, after further investigation and consideration of the
facts, the Company withdrew from further active participation as part of
the PRP Group due to the Company's determination that based on the
available evidence its involvement (if any) at the site was negligible, and
that the $90,000 previously paid by the Company has fully satisfied what
limited responsibility the Company might have at the site.  The Company
does not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operation.

EMPLOYEES.

    As of December 9, 1995, the Company had approximately 5,586 domestic
and foreign production, office and sales employees.  Approximately 1,400
employees were covered by eight union contracts expiring at various dates
through 1998.  The Company has experienced no work stoppages since 1990. 

                      -10-
The Company presently considers its employee relations to be good.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

    The principal executive, sales and administration offices of the
Company are located in Rockford, Michigan and consist of administration and
office buildings of approximately 123,300 square feet.  The Company also
has additional administrative and sales offices in Arkansas, New York,
Italy, Canada and the Asia-Pacific region totaling approximately 32,400
square feet, the majority of which is leased.

    The Company's pigskin tannery, located in Rockford, Michigan,
encompasses approximately 160,000 square feet and is supported by four
procurement facilities in various states.  The Company's footwear
manufacturing operations are conducted at 21 separate facilities, totaling
approximately 954,000 square feet of manufacturing space.  These facilities
are located in Arkansas, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic and Canada.  These totals include the purchase of a
104,000 square foot shoe factory in Kirksville, Missouri, acquired by the
Company on March 22, 1996, in connection with the acquisition of Hy-Test. 
Approximately 444,000 square feet of manufacturing space is under lease at
eight locations and the remaining thirteen facilities are Company-owned. 
The Company believes its footwear manufacturing facilities are generally
among the most modern in the industry.

    The Company maintains thirteen warehouses, located in four states and
Canada, containing approximately 1,100,000 square feet.  The majority of
these warehouses are Company-owned, with approximately 430,000 square feet
at six locations under lease.  In addition, the Company's retail
operations are conducted throughout the United States and as of March 22,
1996, consisted of approximately 58 locations.  All retail locations,
except two factory outlet stores in Company-owned facilities, are subject
to operating leases.

    The Company's Board of Directors has approved $13.0 million to expand the
Company's corporate headquarters complex in Rockford, Michigan.  The Company
expects to fund this expenditure through available balances under a revolving
credit facility.

    The Company believes that its current facilities, including the
planned expansion discussed above, are suitable and adequate to meet its
anticipated needs for the next twelve months.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

    The Company is involved in litigation and various legal matters
arising in the normal course of business.  The Company is also involved in
certain environmental compliance activities, including proceedings

                      -11-

involving cleanup issues associated with a waste disposal site, as more
fully described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company
has considered facts that have been ascertained and opinions of counsel
handling these matters, and does not believe the ultimate resolution of
such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

    No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
covered by this report to a vote of security holders, through the

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1995 COMPARED TO 1994

     Net sales and other operating income from continuing operations
increased 9.4% to $414.0 million during 1995 from $378.5 million in 1994. 
This growth was created by volume increases in the Company's work and sport
boot product lines which increased 32.7% domestically and in the Company's
Hush Puppies and Wolverine International Divisions, which combined posted a
29.3% increase in revenues.  Additionally, sales increases were generated
by United States Department of Defense contracts, which helped offset a
decrease in the Hush Puppies Retail Division resulting from a 1994 decision
to downsize the retail operations.  Sales in the Hush Puppies Wholesale

                      -15-
Division remained flat due to the generally difficult retail environment
for apparel and footwear in the United States.

     The Wolverine Footwear Group continued to grow at a record pace in
1995.  Net sales for the group improved 25.9% on the strength of core work
products offered in both the Wolverine and Caterpillar brands.  These
increases were partially offset by a slight volume shortfall in the Bates
Division which continued to be affected by military downsizing and reduced
emphasis on export markets.  During 1995, the Bates Division strategy was
focused on building a strong civilian uniform business to complement its
military business.

     The Hush Puppies Wholesale Division fell short of 1994 net sales
levels by 2.4%.  During 1995, the loss of certain Company-controlled
distribution channels negatively affected wholesale revenues.  Net sales
and other operating income for the Hush Puppies International Division
increased 17.0% in 1995 over 1994 levels, reflecting new international
opportunities and the growth of established programs.  Additionally, Hush
Puppies Retail sales were down $4.6 million, resulting primarily from the
store closings noted above.

     The Tru-Stitch Footwear Division's net sales were 7.0% below the
record levels posted in 1994 primarily due to a softening of sales in the
catalog sector at the end of 1995.  Despite this reduction, Company
products were placed in several new distribution channels.

     The Wolverine Leathers Division recorded a modest revenue improvement
of 1.1% in 1995.  This performance represents the second consecutive year
of revenue increases for the division.  This growth was due in part to
favorable pricing opportunities in the pigskin procurement markets and
increased volume in proprietary sueded products.  The division's recent
restructuring has placed additional focus on proprietary sueded product.

     Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and other operating income
declined 1.8 percentage points to 29.8% in 1995 from 31.6% in 1994. 
Aggressive promotional pricing programs designed to generate business in
the fourth quarter resulted in margin erosion for the wholesale businesses. 
One-time transition costs to upgrade manufacturing processes and increase
manufacturing flexibility in the Company's Arkansas facilities and costs
associated with increasing upper capacities in the Company's Caribbean
operations also resulted in lower gross margin levels.

     Selling and administrative expenses of $86.0 million in 1995 declined
$4.3 million from $90.3 million in 1994, and as a percentage of net sales
dropped to 20.8% in 1995 from 23.9% in 1994.  Selling, administrative, and
distribution costs associated with the increased sales volume combined with
advertising and promotional investments for the Wolverine Footwear Group
increased costs by $4.2 million in 1995 over the prior year.  Tight cost



                      -16-
controls throughout the remainder of the organization offset the above
noted increases of the Wolverine Footwear Group.  In addition, the Company
lowered its employee benefit expenses and eliminated selling, general, and
administrative costs of the Hush Puppies Retail operations by closing
certain unprofitable stores.

     Interest expense of $4.7 million is $0.7 million greater than the 1994
level of $4.0 million as a result of higher average borrowings throughout
the year to fund working capital requirements associated with sales growth.
The effect of higher average borrowings was partially offset by lower
average borrowing rates.

     Interest income of $1.0 million increased $0.4 million.  The Company
invested a portion of the funds from an equity offering in the fourth
quarter which accounted for approximately one-half of the increase.

     The 1995 effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations of
29.5% increased from 29.0% in 1994. The reduction from the federal
statutory rate of 35% was principally a result of non-taxable earnings of
the Company's Caribbean operations.

     Net earnings from continuing operations of $24.1 million ($1.41 per
share) for 1995 reflect a 33.3% increase over earnings of $18.1 million
($1.10 per share) reported for 1994.  Increased earnings from continuing
operations are primarily a result of the items noted above.

     Primary earnings per share for 1995 was $1.41 compared to $1.01 per
share in 1994.  Fully diluted earnings per share of $1.40 and $1.00 were
reported for 1995 and 1994, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1994 COMPARED TO 1993

     Net sales and other operating income from continuing operations for
1994 of $378.5 million compare with $323.3 million for 1993, a 17.1%

increase.  This increase was primarily the result of record sales in the
Wolverine Footwear Group and the Tru-Stitch Footwear Division. 
Additionally, strong sales increases occurred in The Hush Puppies Company
and the Wolverine Leathers Division.

     The Wolverine Footwear Group's record sales were fueled by a 31.9%
increase in the domestic and international work and sport boot divisions. 
This increase was offset by a 6.1% decrease in the Bates Division.  The
work and sport boot gains continued to reflect superior product
characteristics and the continued trend toward utilizing these products for
everyday use.  The reduced shipments in the Bates Division reflect the
continued downsizing of the United States military and reduced demand in
export markets.



                      -17-
     The Tru-Stitch Footwear Division reached record net sales by recording
a 23.9% increase over record 1993 levels.  The increase resulted from
further increases in catalog accounts and a full year of operations of the
B & B Shoe Company, which was acquired in 1993.

     The Hush Puppies Company recorded a 11.1% increase in volume for the
year with all operating groups reporting an increase.  The brand
repositioning which began in 1992 continued to have a positive impact on
the domestic wholesale business and contributed to gains in the
international and retail operations.  Despite the closing of thirty stores
during the year, the retail operations reported a 4.6% sales increase.

     The Global Operations Group recorded increased net sales in the
Wolverine Leathers Division while its contract sales remained flat.  The
Wolverine Leathers Division recorded a revenue increase of 23.2% which
reflects the opportunities created from increased pricing pressure on
cowhide prices.  This increase was obtained despite the actions taken to
reduce its product offerings and to focus on high-margin products.

     Gross margins increased to 31.6% in 1994 compared to 29.8% in 1993. 
Pricing pressures continued on both the wholesale and retail level and cost
increases on raw materials occurred throughout the Company during the year.
Despite these pressures, the Company was able to improve its margins by
increasing manufacturing efficiencies, providing improved sourcing to the
wholesale groups, and capitalizing on increased production levels which
provides incremental absorption of overhead costs.  These benefits are
expected to continue and should provide the Company with the ability to
maintain its value pricing position.

     Selling and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million in 1994
and as a percentage of net sales rose to 23.9% in 1994.  This increase was
a result of increased investment spending in the Company's core brands as
advertising and marketing expenses of The Hush Puppies Company and the
Wolverine Footwear Group increased 40.3% on a combined basis. 
Additionally, normal cost increases occurred in conjunction with the growth
of the Company and employee profit sharing costs increased as the overall
profitability of the Company improved.

     Interest expense of $4.0 million was down in 1994 from the $4.7
million reported in 1993.  The reduction resulted from reduced average
borrowings during the year and a more favorable interest rate on the
Company's long-term borrowings which resulted from the issuance of
replacement senior debt.

     The 1994 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 29.0%
increased from 28.0% in 1993.  The reduction from the federal statutory
rate of 35% was principally a result of non-taxable earnings of the
Company's Caribbean operations.



                      -18-

     Earnings from continuing operations of $18.1 million ($1.10 per share)
for 1994 reflect a 53.6% increase over earnings of $11.8 million ($.75 per
share) reported for 1993.  In 1994, the Company recorded a loss from
discontinued operations of $1.5 million ($.09 per share), net of income
taxes, to reflect the costs associated with the exiting of its Lamonts
Apparel leased shoe department business.

     Primary earnings per share of $1.01 for 1994 compare to $.73 per share
for 1993.  Fully diluted earnings per share of $1.00 and $.71 were reported
for 1994 and 1993, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

     Net cash provided by operating activities before working capital items
was $29.4 million in 1995 compared to $24.0 million in 1994.  Of these
amounts, $28.1 million in 1995 and $11.6 million in 1994 were used to fund
increases in working capital.  Accounts receivable of $83.4 million at
December 30, 1995, reflect a $12.7 million increase over the $70.7 million
balance at December 31, 1994.  Inventories of $88.4 million at December 30,
1995, reflect a $9.4 million increase over the $79.0 million balance at
December 31, 1994.  The increase in accounts receivable was directly
related to increased net sales and other operating income.  Inventories
were increased to meet anticipated future demand in both wholesaling and
manufacturing operations.  Order backlog was approximately 25% higher at
December 30, 1995, as compared to the previous year, supporting the need
for increased inventories.

     Other current assets of $5.8 million at December 30, 1995 increased
$1.4 million over the 1994 balance of $4.4 million, primarily the result of
reclassifying the current portion of notes receivable from the 1992
disposition of the Brooks athletic footwear business.  Substantially all
Brooks related notes receivable were collected subsequent to the 1995 year
end.

     Additions to property, plant, and equipment of $18.6 million in 1995
compare to the $9.9 million reported in 1994.  The majority of these
expenditures were related to the modernization of corporate facilities,
expansion of warehouse facilities, and purchases of manufacturing equipment
necessary to continue to upgrade the Company's footwear and leather
manufacturing facilities to respond to product demand on a timely and
cost-effective basis.

     Short-term debt increased to $2.3 million in 1995 compared to $1.4
million in 1994.  Long-term debt, excluding current maturities, of $30.6
million at the end of 1995 decreased 29.6% from the $43.5 million balance
at the end of 1994.  The decrease in long-term debt levels are attributable
to the pay down of the Company's revolving credit facility with funds
generated by an equity offering discussed below.



                      -19-

     The Company maintains short-term borrowing and commercial letter-of-credit
facilities of $54.4 million of which $23.2 million and $21.4 million
were used at the end of 1995 and 1994, respectively.

     The combination of cash flows from operations and available credit
facilities are expected to be sufficient to meet future capital needs.

     The Company paid dividends of $2.3 million, or $.14  per share, which
reflects a 27.3% increase over 1994 dividends of $0.11 per share.
Additionally, shares issued under stock incentive plans provided cash of
$4.3 million in 1995 compared to $2.5 million during 1994.

     The Company further strengthened its financial position in 1995
through a successful public offering of 1,737,500 shares of common stock at
$29.875 per share.  The $48.9 million of net proceeds from this offering
were used in part to reduce debt in the fourth quarter and to position the
Company for future growth.  As a result, the current ratio at year end
increased to 5.7 to 1.0 in 1995 from 3.9 to 1.0 in 1994.  The Company's
total debt to total capital ratio improved  to .14 to 1.0 in 1995 from .26
to 1.0 in 1994.

     On February 14, 1996, the Company signed an agreement to acquire
certain assets of the Hy-Test work, safety, and occupational footwear
business of The Florsheim Shoe Company for approximately $22,750,000 in
cash.  This product line acquisition will be financed using existing cash
reserves.

INFLATION.

     Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company over the
past three years nor is it expected to have a significant effect in the
foreseeable future.  The Company continuously attempts to minimize the
effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity.

                WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wolverine
World Wide, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company).  Upon
consolidation, all intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have
been eliminated.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the
Saturday nearest the end of December.  All fiscal years presented herein
are 52-week periods. 

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized on the sale of products when the related goods have
been shipped and legal title has passed to the customer.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased are considered cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all manufacturing
inventories (see Note C). Inventories of the Company's retail operations
are valued using the retail method.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are stated on the basis of cost and include
expenditures for new facilities, major renewals and betterments.  Normal
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.



                       -1-
                WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

ADVERTISING COSTS

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is based on the earnings or loss reported in
the consolidated financial statements.  A deferred income tax asset or
liability is determined by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to
the cumulative temporary differences between the carrying value of assets
and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred
income tax expense is measured by the net change in deferred income tax
assets and liabilities during the year.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average
shares of common stock outstanding during each period and the assumed
exercise of dilutive stock options. Fully diluted earnings per share for
1994 and 1993 also include the effect of converting subordinated notes into
common stock.

Weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings
per share are as follows:

</TABLE>

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
notes receivable, and long-term debt. The Company's estimate of the fair
value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amounts at
December 30, 1995. Fair value was determined using discounted cash flow
analysis and current interest rates for similar instruments.  The Company
does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company does not require collateral or other security on trade accounts
receivable.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts previously reported in 1994 and 1993 have been reclassified
to conform with the presentation used in 1995.


NOTE B - DISCONTINUED OPERATION

During the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a formal plan to
withdraw from its Lamonts Apparel leased shoe department business.  In
connection with this exit plan, an estimated after-tax loss of $1,122,000
was recognized. The loss represents the cost of inventory liquidation,
write-off of leasehold improvements, and anticipated operating results
during the phase-out period.  The exit plan was completed in 1995.

Summarized operating results of the Lamonts business are shown as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and are as follows:

NOTE C - INVENTORIES

Inventories of $70,162,000 at December 30, 1995, and $60,198,000 at
December 31, 1994, have been valued using the LIFO method.  If the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method had been used, inventories would have been
$22,171,000 and $19,667,000 higher than reported at December 30, 1995 and
December 31, 1994, respectively.


NOTE D - NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS

Notes payable to banks consist of unsecured short-term debt of the
Company's Canadian subsidiary. The notes bear interest at the Canadian
prime rate (7.5% at December 30, 1995) plus 2%.

</TABLE>

The 7.8% senior notes to insurance companies require equal annual principal
payments of $4,285,000 on August 15, 1998 through 2004.

The revolving credit agreement, which expires on October 13, 1998, provides
for borrowings up to $50,000,000 with interest payable at variable rates
based on both LIBOR and the prime rate (8.5% at December 30, 1995). 
Maximum borrowings under the agreement were $50,000,000 in 1995 and
$40,000,000 in 1994.

The revolving credit and insurance company loan agreements contain
restrictive covenants which, among other things, require the Company to
maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of working capital and
tangible net worth. The agreements also impose restrictions on securing
additional debt, sale and merger transactions, and the Company's
acquisition of its common stock. At December 30, 1995, unrestricted
retained earnings are $83,374,000.

Principal maturities of long-term debt during the four years subsequent to
1996 are as follows: 1997--$83,000; 1998--$4,370,000; 1999--$4,370,000:

NOTE G - CAPITAL STOCK

On March 10, 1994, and April 19, 1995, the Company announced three-for-two
stock splits on shares of common stock outstanding on March 21, 1994, and
May 1, 1995, respectively.  All share and per share data included in the
consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted for the
increased shares resulting from the stock splits.

The Company has a stock rights plan that is designed to protect stockholder
interests in the event the Company is confronted with coercive or unfair
takeover tactics. Under its terms, each stockholder received one right for
each share of common stock owned. The rights trade separately from common
stock and become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain triggering



                       -5-

NOTE G - CAPITAL STOCK (CONTINUED)

events. Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase
one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred
stock for $40.  The Company has designated 880,000 shares of preferred
stock as Series A junior participating preferred stock for possible future
issuance under the Company's stock rights plan.  Upon issuance, each share
of Series A junior preferred stock will have 100 votes and a preferential
quarterly dividend equal to the greater of $6 per share or 100 times the
dividend declared on the Company's common stock.

In the event the Company is a party to a merger or other business
combination, regardless of whether the Company is the surviving
corporation, rights holders other than the party to the merger will be
entitled to receive common stock of the surviving corporation worth twice
the exercise price of the rights. The plan also provides for protection
against self-dealing transactions by a 15% stockholder or the activities of
an adverse person. The Company may redeem the rights for $.01 each at any
time prior to fifteen days after a triggering event. Unless redeemed
earlier, all rights expire on May 8, 1997.

The Company has stock incentive plans under which options to purchase
shares of common stock may be granted to officers, other key employees, and
nonemployee directors. Options are exercisable in equal annual installments
of 25% over three years beginning on the date the options are granted. All
unexercised options are available for future grants upon their
cancellation.

Certain of the stock incentive plans allow the Company to make stock awards
to officers and other key employees at nominal exercise prices for future
services. Common stock acquired under these plans is subject to certain
restrictions, including prohibition against any sale, transfer, or other
disposition by the officer or employee, and a requirement to forfeit the
award upon termination of employment. These restrictions lapse over a
three- to five-year period from the date of the award. Shares aggregating
63,725 in 1995, 64,762 in 1994 and 45,450 in 1993 were awarded under these
plans. There were no cancellations of stock awards in 1995, 1994 or 1993.
Additional shares awarded will reduce the number of shares identified as
available for future grants in the above table.

NOTE H - RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company has noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering a
majority of its domestic employees. The Company's principal defined benefit
pension plan provides benefits based on the employee's years of service and
final average earnings (as defined), while the other plans provide benefits
at a fixed rate per year of service. The Company intends to annually
contribute amounts deemed necessary to maintain the plans on a sound
actuarial basis.

The Company also has individual deferred compensation agreements with
certain key employees that entitle them to receive payments from the
Company for a period of fifteen to eighteen years following retirement.
Under the terms of the individual contracts, the employees are eligible for
reduced benefits upon early retirement.

In addition, the Company sponsors a noncontributory, defined benefit plan
that provides postretirement life insurance benefits to full-time employees
who have worked ten or more consecutive years and attained age 60 while
employed by the Company.  The Company does not provide postretirement
medical benefits.

The Company has a defined contribution money accumulation plan covering
substantially all employees that provides for Company contributions based
on earnings. In 1994, the Company combined this plan with its principal
defined benefit pension plan for funding purposes. Contributions to the
money accumulation plan were $1,050,000 in 1995, $935,000 in 1994 and
$760,000 in 1993.

</TABLE>

The Company has provided for substantially all taxes that would be payable
if accumulated earnings of its Puerto Rican subsidiary were distributed.
Similar taxes on the unremitted earnings of the Company's foreign
affiliates have not been provided because such earnings are considered
permanently invested. The additional taxes that would be payable if
unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates were distributed are not
significant.


NOTE J - LITIGATION

The Company is involved in various environmental claims and other legal
actions arising in the normal course of business. After taking into
consideration legal counsel's evaluation of such actions, management is of
the opinion that their outcome will not have a significant effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE K - INDUSTRY INFORMATION

The Company is principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of footwear,
including casual shoes, slippers, moccasins, dress shoes, boots, uniform
shoes and work shoes. The Company is also the largest domestic tanner of
pigskin, which is used in a significant portion of shoes manufactured and
sold by the Company and sold to other domestic and foreign manufacturers of
shoes and other products. Royalty income is derived from licensing the
Company's trademarks to domestic and foreign licensees. As part of its
footwear business, the Company operates a number of domestic retail shoe
stores that sell Company-manufactured  products as well as footwear
manufactured by unaffiliated companies. Foreign operations consist of a
75%-owned Canadian subsidiary and factories located in the Dominican
Republic and Mexico that produce shoe uppers for domestic operations.
Export sales, foreign operations, and related assets are not significant.

The Company markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
sector. Although the Company closely monitors the credit worthiness of its
customers and adjusts its credit policies and limits as needed, a
substantial portion of its debtors' ability to discharge amounts owed is
dependent upon the retail economic environment. The Company does not
believe that it is dependent upon any single customer, since none account
for more than 10% of consolidated net sales.


NOTE L - QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)

The Company reports its quarterly results of operations on the basis of
12-week periods for each of the first three quarters and a 16-week period
for the fourth quarter.

The following tabulation presents the Company's unaudited quarterly results
of operations for 1995 and 1994. Certain reclassifications have been made
to the 1994 amounts originally reported in the Company's quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q to segregate the results of a discontinued operation.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Wolverine World Wide, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wolverine
World Wide, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995, and December 31,
1994, and the related consolidated statements of stockholders' equity,
operations and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended December 30, 1995.  Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a).  These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 30,
1995, and December 31, 1994, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

the event that less than 65 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the
date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the 15th day following the day on which such notice of the date
of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made,
whichever first occurs.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the
stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares
of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and
(iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.

     Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2 of Article II, provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 2 of Article II shall be deemed to preclude
discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the
annual meeting.

     The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2 of
Article II, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall
not be transacted.

     Section 3.  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the
Board of Directors, or by the Chief Executive Officer, or upon the written
request of stockholders holding in the aggregate at least forty (40)
percentum of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the corporation
entitled to vote on the business to be transacted at such meeting,
delivered to such officer.  Such stockholder request shall state the



                       -2-
purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.  The meetings shall be held on
a date fixed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, or
in the case of a stockholder request, on a date determined by the
Secretary.  In the event the Secretary questions the propriety of any
meeting requested by stockholders, such request shall be submitted to the
Board of Directors at its next meeting, and the determination of the Board
as to such propriety shall be final.  No special meeting of stockholders
shall be called for the purpose of removing a director or directors, for
electing directors, or for amending the By-Laws of the corporation, such
matters to be considered only at the annual meeting of stockholder,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a special meeting of stockholders may be called for
the purpose of removing a director for cause, such term to be as defined
under Delaware law, provided further that such cause is set forth in the
request for meeting.

     Section 4.  Written notice of all meetings of stockholders, stating
the time, place and in the case of special meetings, the purpose or
purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote
thereat, at least ten (10) days before the date fixed for the meeting.

     Section 5.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of
and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at
least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held and which place shall be specified in the
notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where said
meeting is to be held, and the list shall be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present.

     Section 6.  The holders of a majority of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for
the transaction of business, except as otherwise provide by statute or by
the Certificate of Incorporation.  If, however, such quorum shall not be
present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the officer of
the corporation presiding as chairman of the meeting shall have the power
to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or
represented.  At such adjourned meetings at which a quorum shall be present
or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified.





                       -3-
     Section 7.  Except as otherwise set forth in Section 1(f) of Article
III hereunder, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes
or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in
which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of
such question.

     Section 8.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
creating any class of stock, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the
stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share
of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.

     Section 9.  Meetings of stockholders generally shall follow accepted
rules of parliamentary procedure, subject to the following:

          (a)  The chairman of the meeting shall have absolute authority
     over matters of procedure, and there shall be no appeal from the
     ruling of the chairman.  If, in his absolute discretion, the chairman
     deems it advisable to dispense with the rules of parliamentary
     procedure as to any one meeting of stockholders or part thereof, he
     shall so state and shall clearly state the rules under which the
     meeting or appropriate part thereof shall be conducted.

          (b)  If disorder should arise which prevents the continuation
     of the legitimate business of the meeting, the chairman may quit the
     chair and announce the adjournment of the meeting; and upon his so
     doing, the meeting is immediately adjourned.

          (c)  The chairman may ask or require that anyone not a bona
     fide stockholder or proxy leave the meeting.

          (d) A resolution or motion shall be considered for vote only
     if proposed by a stockholder or a duly authorized proxy and 
     seconded by a stockholder or a duly authorized proxy other than the
     individual who proposed the resolution or motion.

     Section 10.  At or prior to any meeting of stockholders, the Board
of Directors, or, if the Board of Directors shall have taken no action with
respect thereto, the chairman of the meeting, may appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  In case any
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be
filled by appointment made by the person presiding at the meeting or
entitled to preside at the adjourned meeting.  Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his ability.


                       -4-
     Section 11.  The Secretary of the corporation shall furnish the
inspectors with a certificate setting forth the number of shares
outstanding and entitled to vote, the voting power of each, the number of
shares required to make a quorum and the number of shares required to be
voted on any issue presented to the meeting if more than a simple majority
of the quorum present.  The inspectors shall determine the shares
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and
effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right
to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the
results and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with
fairness to all shareholders.  On request of the person presiding at the
meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall
make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by
them.  The inspectors shall execute a certificate of the results of the
election or vote found by them.  Any report or certificate made by them
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as
certified by them.  In their determination of the validity and effect of
proxies, the inspectors shall make such determination, to the extent
possible, so as not to disenfranchise any stockholder.

     Section 12.  The inspectors may employ agents or other persons to
assist in their duties.  The meetings of the inspectors shall be closed
to all persons except as may be requested by the inspectors, provided that
the inspectors shall permit a reasonable time after their initial
tabulations for the presentation and determination of challenges to the
validity and effect of proxies and ballots.  In the case of an election
contest, whenever the representative of one or more sides is present
during the course of the inspectors' duties, a representative of all
other sides shall be afforded the opportunity to attend.

     Section 13.  In the tabulation of votes cast by proxies, it shall
not be necessary for proxies to execute a ballot on matters, voting
instructions (including no vote) for which are contained on the form of
proxy itself, and in the absence of a ballot executed on such proxies, the
proxy itself will be deemed a written ballot and tabulated in accordance
with the directions contained thereon.

     Section 14.  The person presiding at a meeting of the stockholders
may close the polls after the request for submission of proxies and ballots,
upon the temporary adjournment of the meeting called to tabulate the
proxies and ballots, or within a reasonable time thereafter.  After the
polls are closed, no proxy, revocation of proxy or ballot shall be accepted
by or considered in the tabulation of proxies and ballots.

     Section 15.  In the event it becomes necessary to adjourn a meeting
of stockholders beyond the day of the scheduled meeting in order to
determine the results of any election or vote, said meeting may be
adjourned from time to time by the person presiding or entitled to preside,


                       -5-
with such meeting to be reconvened at the principal offices of the
corporation in Rockford, Michigan.  The only matter to be acted upon at
such reconvened meeting shall be the acceptance and filing of the report
from the inspectors of election.


                                 ARTICLE III

                                  DIRECTORS

     Section 1.  Directors of the corporation shall be elected,
replaced and removed as follows:

          (a)  Number and Qualification of Directors.  The number of
     directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be
     not less than five (5) persons.  Subject to the limit above specified,
     the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by
     resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that a vacancy in the
     Board of Directors need not be filled immediately, and until filled,
     such lesser number shall constitute the entire Board of Directors. 
     Except as otherwise provided in this Section, directors shall be
     elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, and each such
     director elected shall hold office until the annual meeting for the
     year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor
     is elected.  A director need not be a stockholder, a citizen of the
     United States or a resident of the State of Delaware.

         (b)  Classification.  The Board of Directors shall be divided
     into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall
     consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total
     number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  At
     the 1990 annual meeting of stockholders, Class I directors shall be
     elected for a one- year term, Class II directors for a two-year term
     and Class III directors for a three-year term. At each succeeding
     annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the class of
     directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold
     office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held
     in the third year following the year of their election. 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more
     classes or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting
     separately as a class, to elect directors at an annual or special
     meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of
     vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed
     by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto,
     and such directors shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this
     Section 1(b) of ARTICLE III, and the number of such directors shall
     not be counted in determining the maximum number of directors
     permitted under Section 1(a) of ARTICLE III hereof, in each case
     unless expressly provided by the Certificate of Incorporation.


                       -6-
         (c)  Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.  Subject to
     the right of the holders of any series of preferred stock then
     outstanding, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors caused
     by resignation, removal, death, disqualification or other incapacity,
     and any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
     number of directors, shall be filled exclusively by a majority vote of
     the directors then in office, whether or not a quorum and shall not be
     filled by the stockholders.  When the number of directors is changed,
     any newly created or eliminated directorship shall be so apportioned
     among the classes of directors as to make all classes as nearly equal
     in number as possible.  Each director chosen to fill a vacancy or a
     newly created directorship shall hold office for the term coinciding
     with the class of his or her directorship and until his successor
     shall be elected and qualify.  No decrease in the number of directors
     constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
     incumbent director.

          (d)  Removal.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any
     series of preferred stock then outstanding, any or all of the
     directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause.

          (e)  Resignation.  Any director may resign at any time and such
     resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Chief
     Executive Officer or the Secretary unless otherwise specified in the
     resignation.

          (f)  Amendment or Repeal.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of these By-Laws to the contrary, the provisions contained in this
     Section 1 shall not be amended, altered, modified or repealed, and no
     provision inconsistent with this Section 1 may be adopted, except upon
     either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-
     thirds of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote in
     elections of directors or (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of
     the whole Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of the holders
     of a majority of such outstanding stock present in person or
     represented by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

          (g)  Nomination of Directors.  Subject to the rights of
     holders of any classes or series of preferred stock then outstanding,
     only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
     procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors.  Nomination
     of persons for election to the Board of the corporation at an annual
     meeting may be made at the annual meeting of stockholders by or at
     the direction of the Board of Directors by any nominating committee
     or person appointed by the Board or by any stockholder of the
     corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the
     annual meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in
     this Section 1(g) of Article III.  Such nominations, other than those
     made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to


                       -7-
     timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be
     timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and
     received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
     less than 50 days nor more than 75 days; provided, however, that in
     the event that less than 65 days' notice or prior public disclosure
     of the date of an annual meeting is given or made to stockholders,
     notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later
     than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which
     such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
     disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  Such stockholder's notice
     to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
     stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a
     Director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of
     the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person,
     (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation
     which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other
     information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed
     in solicitations for proxies for election of Directors pursuant to Rule
     14a under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as
     to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address
     of stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of capital
     stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the
     stockholder.  The corporation may require any proposed nominee to
     furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the
     corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
     serve as Director of the corporation.  No person shall be eligible for
     election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in
     accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

          The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
     determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made
     in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so
     determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective
     nomination shall be disregarded.

     Section 2.  The business of the corporation shall be managed by its
Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation
and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By- Laws directed or required to
be exercised or done by the stockholders.

                      MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Section 3.  The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold
meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Delaware.

     Section 4.  The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors
shall be held following the annual meeting of stockholders, and no notice


                       -8-
of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order
legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present.  In
the event such meeting is not held immediately following the annual meeting
of stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be
specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of
the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed
by all of the directors.

     Section 5.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board.

     Section 6.  Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chief
Executive Officer or Secretary or by any two (2) directors on two (2) days'
notice to each director.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be
specified in the notice of such meeting.

     Section 7.  At all meetings of the Board a majority of the directors
(other than directors elected at that meeting) shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors
present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the
Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.  If a quorum
shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall
be present.

     Section 8.  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting, if a written consent thereto is signed by
all members of the Board or of such committee as the case may be, and such
written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or
committee.

     Section 9.  The Board of Directors or any committee designated by the
Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of such Board, or
committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can
hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this section
shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

                           COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS

     Section 10.  The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive Committee
whose membership shall consist of such  members of the Board of Directors
as it may deem advisable from time to time to serve during the pleasure of


                       -9-
the Board.  The Board  of Directors may also appoint directors to serve as
alternates for members of the committee in the absence or disability of
regular members.  The Board of Directors may fill any vacancies as they
occur.  The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise the powers of
the Board of Directors in the management of the business affairs and
property of the corporation during the intervals between meetings of the
Board of Directors, subject to law and to such limitations and control as
the Board of Directors may impose from time to time, except that the

          (b)  Fill vacancies in the membership of the Board of Directors
     or the Executive Committee;

          (c)  Declare dividends;

          (d)  Authorize the issuance of stock.

     Section 11.  The Board of Directors may designate such other
committees as it may deem appropriate, and such committees shall exercise
the authority delegated to them.

     Section 12.  Each committee provided for above shall meet as often as
its business may require and may fix a day and time each week or at other
intervals for regular meetings, notice of which shall not be required. 
Whenever the day fixed for a meeting shall fall on a holiday, the meeting
shall be held on the business day following or on such other day as the
committee may determine. Special meetings of the committees may be called
by the chairman, and notice thereof may be given to the members by
telephone, telegram or letter.  A majority of its members shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of the business of any of the committees.  A
record of the proceedings of each committee shall be kept and presented to
the Board of Directors.  The chairperson of any of the standing or special
committees of the Board of Directors may appoint one or more independent
directors to serve as alternates for members of the committee in the
absence or disability of regular members.

                          COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Section 13.  The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and a
stated salary as director.  No such payment shall preclude any director
from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.  Members of special or standing committees may be
allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.


                      -10-
                  CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING

     Section 14.  In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than
ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Any stockholders of record
seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by
written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the
Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors shall
promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which
such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.  If
no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10)
days following the receipt of such a request, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed
written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent
of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
stockholders meetings are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of
the corporation.  Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the
Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the
close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.


                                  ARTICLE IV

                                   NOTICES

their addresses appearing on the books of the corporation.  Notice by mail
shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be mailed. 
Notice to directors may also be given by telegram, which shall be deemed
given at the time when the same shall be sent.

     Section 2.  Whenever any notice is required to be given under the
provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these By-Laws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons
entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent thereto.  The attendance of a director at a


                      -11-
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a
director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting has not been lawfully
called or convened.


                                  ARTICLE V

Treasurer.  The Board of Directors may also choose one or more Vice
Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers, and
such other officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time
determine.  Any two or more offices, except those of Chief Executive
Officer and Vice President, or Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, may
be held by the same person.

     Section 2.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer and the President shall be selected from among the
members of the Board of Directors.  No other officer need be a member of
the Board of Directors.

                                TERM OF OFFICE

     Section 3.  Each officer shall hold office at the pleasure of the
Board.  The Board of Directors may remove any officer for cause or without

corporation unless otherwise specified in the resignation.  If the office
of any officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be filled by
the Board.

                          THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

                        WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.
                    SUSTAINED GROWTH (THREE YEAR) PLAN
                             1993-1995 PERIOD



                                 ARTICLE I

                         ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN


     1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive
(Three Year) Plan, as summarized herein is established by Wolverine World
Wide, Inc. ("Wolverine or the "Company") for the three-year fiscal period
of 1993-1995 and may be continued, intact or as amended, from year to year,
at the Company's option.

     1.2  The primary purpose of the plan is to:

          (a)  Encourage longer range strategic planning and get away
     from over-dependence on short-term performance which could be at
     the expense of achieving a strategic position/advantage in the
     marketplace.

          (b)  Encourage cooperation among all the units of the
     Company so as to foster a closer and more cooperative association
     and sense of teamwork.

          (c)  Encourage key management individuals to enter and
     continue in the employ of the Company.


                                ARTICLE II

                            CONCEPT OF THE PLAN


     2.1  (a)  The primary concept of the plan is to establish a
     financial goal for each three-year time period for the Company. 
     These periods are overlapping.  The goal needs to be both closely
     identified with the interests of the shareholders and easily
     understood.

          (b)  The goals for all plans through 1995 are expressed in
     terms of earnings per share (E.P.S.).  This meets the objectives
     stated above.  The definition of "earnings per share," for this
     purpose, is the Company's net after-tax earnings per common share
     of stock after all expenses and taxes, except for the payment of
     the three-year bonus itself.


                                ARTICLE III

                         GOALS FOR 1993-1995 PLAN

Note:  In order to pay a bonus, E.P.S. in the third year must be at least
20% of the total E.P.S. goal for the three-year period (e.g., at Threshold,
E.P.S. for 1995 must be $0.82 per share, 20% x $4.10).

SPECIAL NOTE

          The Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce any
Participant's bonus if his/her performance was not satisfactory during any
year of the plan and/or if his/her unit did not achieve 80% of the Unit
Target Goal for the three-year period (as noted in the Executive Annual
Bonus Plan) and/or if the Chief Executive Officer recommends a reduction in
an individual's bonus.

PAYOUT AGAINST GOALS

          Payout under the 1993-1995 Plan as a percentage of each
Participant's individual target bonus will be made according to the final

                             MANNER OF PAYMENT


CASH PAYOUT AND RESTRICTED STOCK.

     4.1  GENERAL.  Each Participant will receive part of his or her bonus
in cash and part in restricted stock according to the terms below.

     4.2  CASH PAYOUT.  Each Participant will receive a cash payment equal
to fifty percent (50%) of his or her formula award.  The Company will make
the cash payment within 30 days of acceptance of the fiscal year 1995
certified audit by the Board of Directors.

     4.3  RESTRICTED STOCK.  Each Participant will also receive a grant of
restricted stock on the same date the cash payment is made pursuant to
Section 4.2.  The number of shares of restricted stock a Participant shall
receive will equal seventy five percent (75%) of the formula award divided
by the market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant,
rounded to the nearest whole share.  The restrictions imposed on the
restricted stock shall lapse in three equal annual installments commencing
one year following the grant date.  Each award of restricted stock shall be
evidenced by a restricted stock agreement containing such terms and
conditions, including vesting schedules, consistent with the provisions of
the Plan.


                                 ARTICLE V

                       TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION


     5.1  RETIREMENT, DEATH, OR TOTAL DISABILITY.  If a Participant ceases
to be a Participant before the end of any performance period and more than
12 months after the beginning of such performance period because of death,
normal or early retirement under the Company's retirement plan, as then in
effect, or total disability under the Company's long-term disability plan,
an award shall be paid to him or his estate after the end of such
performance period prorated as follows.  The award, if any, for such
performance period shall be equal to 100 percent of the formula award of
the amount that he would have received if he had been a Participant during
the entire performance period, multiplied by the ratio of his full months
as a Participant during that performance period to the number of months in
that performance period.  The award, if any, shall (unless the Company
otherwise determines) only be made in the form of a cash payout and no
shares of restricted stock shall be awarded.




                       -3-
     5.2  OTHER TERMINATION.  If an employee ceases to be a Participant
during any performance period(s), or prior to actual receipt of the award
for a previous period because of the Participant's termination of
employment for any reason other than described in Section 5.1 above, the
Participant will not be entitled to any award for such performance period. 
If a Participant continues in Wolverine's employment but no longer is
approved by the Board's Compensation Committee to participate in future
periods, his/her eligibility for a prorated award in current periods will
be determined solely by the Compensation Committee and communicated to the
Participant.  Factors used in this determination could include the
Participant's past and current performance, reasons for the change in the
participation, and other job-related factors as determined by the
Compensation Committee.


                                ARTICLE VI

                                  SUMMARY


          This communication is meant to summarize the major elements of
the Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan.  The
plan shall not be construed to give and does not give any Participant the
right to be retained in the employ of the Company.

          The Board may discontinue the plan at any time, suspend the plan
at any time or from time to time, and from time to time amend the plan in
any respect, except that no amendment may be made which either would cause
any Participant to be deprived of any award previously earned but not paid
or would adversely affect any award such Participant might receive for any
performance period which commenced before such amendment was made.  The
Board and/or the Compensation Committee may review at any time the plan and
its administration to determine whether the objectives of the plan continue
to be met.  Where appropriate, the Chief Executive Officer will recommend
changes in the plan for adoption by the Board of Directors and/or the
Compensation Committee.

     has determined that this goal meets the objectives stated above. 
     The definition of "earnings per share," for this purpose, is the
     Company's net after-tax earnings per common share of stock after
     all expenses and taxes, except for the payment of the three-year
     bonus itself.

                             MANNER OF PAYMENT


CASH PAYOUT AND RESTRICTED STOCK.

     4.1  GENERAL.  Each Participant will receive part of his or her bonus
in cash and part in restricted stock according to the terms below.

     4.2  CASH PAYOUT.  Each Participant will receive a cash payment equal
to fifty percent (50%) of his or her formula award.  The Company will make
the cash payment within 30 days of acceptance of the fiscal year 1996
certified audit by the Board of Directors.

     4.3  RESTRICTED STOCK.  Each Participant will also receive a grant of
restricted stock on the same date the cash payment is made pursuant to
Section 4.2.  The number of shares of restricted stock a Participant shall
receive will equal seventy five percent (75%) of the formula award divided
by the market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant,
rounded to the nearest whole share.  The restrictions imposed on the
restricted stock shall lapse in three equal annual installments commencing
one year following the grant date.  Each award of restricted stock shall be
evidenced by a restricted stock agreement containing such terms and
conditions, including vesting schedules, consistent with the provisions of
the Plan.


                                 ARTICLE V

                       TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION


     5.1  RETIREMENT, DEATH, OR TOTAL DISABILITY.  If a Participant ceases
to be a Participant before the end of any performance period and more than
12 months after the beginning of such performance period because of death,
normal or early retirement under the Company's retirement plan, as then in
effect, or total disability under the Company's long-term disability plan,
an award shall be paid to him or his estate after the end of such
performance period prorated as follows.  The award, if any, for such
performance period shall be equal to 100 percent of the formula award of
the amount that he would have received if he had been a Participant during
the entire performance period, multiplied by the ratio of his full months
as a Participant during that performance period to the number of months in
that performance period.  The award, if any, shall (unless the Company
otherwise determines) only be made in the form of a cash payout and no
shares of restricted stock shall be awarded.




                       -3-
     5.2  OTHER TERMINATION.  If an employee ceases to be a Participant
during any performance period(s), or prior to actual receipt of the award
for a previous period because of the Participant's termination of
employment for any reason other than described in Section 5.1 above, the
Participant will not be entitled to any award for such performance period. 
If a Participant continues in Wolverine's employment but no longer is
approved by the Board's Compensation Committee to participate in future
periods, his/her eligibility for a prorated award in current periods will
be determined solely by the Compensation Committee and communicated to the
Participant.  Factors used in this determination could include the
Participant's past and current performance, reasons for the change in
participation and other job-related factors as determined by the
Compensation Committee.


                                ARTICLE VI

                                  SUMMARY

          This communication is meant to summarize the major elements of
the Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan.  The
plan shall not be construed to give and does not give any Participant the
right to be retained in the employ of the Company.

          The Board may discontinue the plan at any time, suspend the plan
at any time or from time to time, and from time to time amend the plan in
any respect, except that no amendment may be made which either would cause
any Participant to be deprived of any award previously earned but not paid
or would adversely affect any award such Participant might receive for any
performance period which commenced before such amendment was made.  The
Board and/or the Compensation Committee may review at any time the plan and
its administration to determine whether the objectives of the plan continue
to be met.  Where appropriate, the Chief Executive Officer will recommend
changes in the plan for adoption by the Board of Directors and/or the
Compensation Committee.

              EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE (THREE YEAR) PLAN
                             1995-1997 PERIOD



                                 ARTICLE I

                         ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN


     1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive
(Three Year) Plan, as summarized herein, is established by Wolverine World
Wide, Inc. ("Wolverine" or the "Company") for the three-year fiscal period
of 1995-1997 and may be continued, intact or as amended, from year to year,
at the Company's option.

     1.2  The primary purposes of the plan are to:

          (a)  Encourage longer range strategic planning and not
     stress over-dependence on short-term performance which could be
     at the expense of long-term increases in stockholder value and/or
     achieving a strategic position/advantage in the marketplace.

          (b)  Encourage cooperation among all the units of the
     Company so as to foster a closer and more cooperative association
     and sense of teamwork.

          (c)  Encourage key management individuals to enter and
     continue in the employ of the Company.


                                ARTICLE II

                            CONCEPT OF THE PLAN


     2.1  (a)  The primary concept of the plan is to establish a
     financial goal for each three-year time period for the Company. 
     These periods are overlapping.  The goal needs to be both closely
     identified with the interests of the stockholders and easily
     understood. 

          (b)  The goals for all plans through 1997 are expressed in
     terms of earnings per share (E.P.S.).  The Compensation Committee
     has determined that this goal meets the objectives stated above. 
     The definition of "earnings per share," for this purpose, is the
     Company's net after-tax earnings per common share of stock after
     all expenses and taxes, except for the payment of the three-year
     bonus itself.

Note:  In order to pay a bonus, E.P.S. in the third year must be at least
20 percent of the total E.P.S. goal for the three-year period (e.g., at
Threshold, E.P.S. for 1997 must be $1.13 per share, 20% X $5.67).

SPECIAL NOTE

          The Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce any
Participant's bonus if his/her performance was not satisfactory during any
year of the Plan and/or if his/her unit did not achieve 80 percent of the
Unit Target Goal for the three-year period (as noted in the Executive
Annual Bonus Plan) and/or if the Chief Executive Officer recommends a
reduction in an individual's bonus.

                                 FOR 1996


                                 ARTICLE I

                         ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN

1.1  The Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, as
     described herein, is established by Wolverine World Wide, Inc.
     (Company) for the fiscal year of 1996, and may be continued, intact or
     as amended, from year to year, at the Company's option.

1.2  The Objectives of the Plan are to:

     (a)  Motivate participants to improve the Company's profitability and
          growth by the attainment of carefully planned earnings, sales,
          and other contributory goals.

     (b)  Promote initiative and cooperation with awards based on division
          and corporate earnings.

     (c)  Encourage outstanding individuals to enter and continue in the
          employ of the Company.


                                ARTICLE II

                               PARTICIPATION

2.1  Participants shall be certain senior division and corporate employees
     designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the
     Company and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board.

2.2  Employees enrolled during the first six periods of the fiscal year are
     eligible for all the applicable award for that year. Employees
     enrolled after the sixth period shall not be eligible for any award
     for that fiscal year.


                                ARTICLE III

                             PERFORMANCE GOALS

3.1  The units of measure in the Plan are described below:


     (a)  Unit Goals (operating divisions or profit centers) are measured
          by the attainment of predetermined (1) Profit Before Tax (80-100%
          weighting), (2) Annual Sales (0-20% weighting).

          Unit (divisional) participants will generally have their bonus
          comprised of unit profits of 56%, unit sales of 14%, corporate
          goals (profits and sales) of 15%, and personal goals of 15%. 
          Note:  Personal goals will be computed and paid by multiplying
          the participants' percentage achievement times 150% of target
          payout for the personal goal element.  No credit will be given
          for achieving personal goals if threshold profit goals are not
          attained unless specifically approved by the Compensation
          Committee.  

     (b)  Corporate goals are measured by the attainment of predetermined
          (1) Corporate-wide Profit Before Tax, Bonus, and 401(k) Plan
          (PBTB4), (80% weighting) and (2) Corporate-wide Sales, (20%
          weighting) objectives.  

          Corporate participants will generally have their bonus comprised
          of corporate profits 64%, corporate sales 16% and personal goals
          20%.  Note:  Personal goals will be computed and paid by
          multiplying the participants' percentage achievement times the
          maximum payout for the personal goal element.  No credit will be
          given for achieving personal goals if threshold profit goals are
          not attained unless specifically approved by the Compensation
          Committee.

     (c)  Participants will receive notification of their specific
          allocations for divisional, corporate and personal goals
          computations.

3.2  This plan recognizes three Levels of Goal Attainment for sales
     components and four levels of Goal Attainment for profit components.

     (a)  Target attainment which qualifies for 100% of eligible bonus.

     (b)  Threshold attainment which qualifies for 50% of eligible bonus.

     (c)  Maximum attainment which qualifies for 150% of eligible bonus.

     (d)  Super Maximum.  In addition, achievement above stated maximum
          profit goal attainment will qualify the participant for up to an
          additional 50% of target bonus payment (Super-Maximum).  This
          additional potential incentive will be paid on a pro-rata basis
          if profits achieved are between stated maximum and super-maximum
          objectives.



                                    -2-

          Target, Threshold, and Maximum and Super Maximum goals as well as
          unit and corporate weightings are approved by the Compensation
          Committee.  These goals are attached according to your
          unit(s)/corporate assignment.  Personal goals have also been
          communicated to each participant.

3.3  Attainment levels falling between goals (i.e. Threshold Target,
     Maximum, and Super Maximum goals) will cause the award level to be
     adjusted by the use straight-line interpolation between the
     appropriate levels.

3.4  Each individual eligible for this Plan has been assigned a target
     bonus percentage.  These targets are determined based on
     responsibility and/or performance levels and approved by the
     Compensation Committee.

3.5  A participant's actual bonus for 1995 is determined by applying the
     Target Bonus to the Level of Goal Attainment for the unit(s) and/or
     corporate to which the participant has been assigned for purposes of
     this Plan. 

3.6  Each Plan participant has been assigned to one or more units and/or
     corporate.  This assignment is expressed as a percentage (0-100%) and is
     based on the participant's position and responsibility in the Company. 
     Thus, a participant's final bonus calculation will be the sum of each
     assigned unit/corporate achievement multiplied by his/her assigned
     percentage in that unit(s) and/or corporate.

3.7  The formula therefore for calculating an individual's bonus is as
     follows:  Bonus equals base salary paid in 1996 multiplied by the
     eligible Target Bonus multiplied by the Level of Goal Attainment
     against target goals by the unit(s)/corporate area to which a
     participant is assigned. 

     Bonus = Salary X Eligible Target % X Weighted Level of Goal
     Attainment.

3.8  Plan Participants will have this Plan and their individual goals,
     assignments, and factors explained to them.  Information will be
     provided quarterly showing estimated progress toward the established
     goals.

                                ARTICLE IV

                            GENERAL PROVISIONS

4.1  PAYOUT OF AWARDS.

     Bonuses earned under the Plan will be paid as soon as is practicable
     after the completion of the audit of the Company's books for the

     fiscal year and approval of the awards by the Compensation Committee
     of the Board of Directors.

4.2  ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT.

     Only those employees actively at work on the last day of the fiscal
     year shall be eligible for any bonus earned that year.  In addition,
     the Compensation Committee of the Board may, at its discretion,
     interpret or modify this Plan and make other awards if a termination
     is due to disability, retirement or death prior to the end of the
     year.

4.3  EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.

     The Plan shall not be construed to give and does not give any employee
     the right to be continued in the employ of the Company.


                                 ARTICLE V

                          SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS

5.1  MAXIMUM BONUS.

     There will be no limitation on the total maximum bonuses as long as
     the payment of bonuses and dividends is not greater than corporate
     PBTB4.  If, however, corporate earnings were below the Threshold goal,
     then bonuses in those units attaining Target goal or greater would not
     be reduced below Target Bonus nor would bonuses in units earning
     between Threshold and Target goals be reduced below Threshold Bonuses. 

5.2  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCRETION.

     Notwithstanding the above, the Compensation Committee of the Board
     reserves the right to reduce the formula bonus of any participant
     deemed not to have performed satisfactorily in his or her
     position/assignment during the year.  

     Likewise the Compensation Committee may increase a formula bonus if
     there is compelling reason to do so.
