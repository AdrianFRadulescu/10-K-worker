                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

ZERO Corporation (the "Company", ZERO, or "Registrant") was incorporated in
Delaware in 1988 as a successor in interest to a California corporation of the
same name that was originally incorporated in 1952. Its executive offices are
located at 444 South Flower Street, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, CA 90071-2922,
telephone (213) 629-7000.

The Company considers itself a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of
engineered solutions to enclose, cool and carry electronic equipment. The
Company's system packaging business designs and integrates standard and custom
electronic enclosures and cabinets, and related components such as card cages
for printed circuit boards, backplanes, power supplies and thermal management
systems. Over seventy percent of ZEROs net sales in fiscal 1995 were linked to
the electronics industry, primarily through customers doing business in the
telecommunications, data processing and instrumentation markets. ZEROs
engineered cases include custom and standard deep drawn aluminum ZERO boxes; the
ZERO Halliburton(R) luggage, carrying cases and attaches; thermoformed and
rotationally molded plastic cases and enclosures; other standard and custom
fabricated cases (marketed under the Anvil(R) Cases brand name); and specialized
case hardware. The Company is also a designer, manufacturer and marketer of
various products used in the airline/air cargo industry including specialized
aluminum, polycarbonate and fiberglass air cargo containers; patented
telescoping baggage/cargo systems; air cargo restraint systems and hardware; and
transit cases engineered to meet specifications of the Air Transport
Association.

ZERO's operations are classified under two business segments: Enclosures and
Accessories, and Other. Information about ZERO's business segments is set forth
in Note 8 "Segment Information" on page 24 of the 1995 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

During the three years ended March 31, 1995, the Company did not derive a
material portion of its sales or net income from its foreign operations nor has
the Company been dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss
of which would have a material adverse effect on its operations.

Patents, licenses, franchises and concessions are not an important factor in
ZERO's overall production process and are not material to its results of
operation.

Research and development activities are not a significant part of the Company's
business. During the year ended March 31, 1995, the Company spent less than 1%
of net sales on research and development activities.

Acquisitions

ZERO is committed to enhance its growth through acquisitions that would
complement the existing business. Prior to June 16, 1995, the Company acquired
the assets of Electro-Mechanical Imagineering, Inc. (EMI), a manufacturer of
products to encase, protect and mount closed-circuit television security devices
that generated annual revenues of approximately $4.5 million. In addition, as of
June 16, 1995, the Company has signed letters of intent outstanding to acquire
two other companies, which, when combined with EMI, have combined sales of
approximately $16 million. Negotiations of definitive agreements and diligence
reviews are currently being performed and the Company expects to complete these
acquisitions in the summer of 1995. These companies' product lines complement
existing operations and markets.

Market Trends

Three trends have increased ZERO's sales activity within the rapidly growing 
electronics marketplace. One trend is the miniaturization of electronic 
products, which has increased the demand for highly specialized systems 
packaging and thermal management solutions. A second trend is lower-priced 
electronic products, which has increased both unit sales and the size of the 
markets ZERO serves. A third trend is the worldwide growth in 
telecommunications, which has greatly expanded the opportunity to enclose and 
cool products globally.

ZERO's sales in the telecommunications, data processing and instrumentation 
markets increased to $115 million from $100 million for the years ended 
March 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. This is due to the strength in the 
telecommunications industry as well as the demand for products to cool machine 
tool controls, cellular antennae equipment and other electronics that are 
located in inclement environments. Increased activity within the data processing
market was greatly influenced by a price performance curve which accelerated the
sale of mid-range computers requiring sophisticated cooling and packaging. 
ZERO's increased sales within the electronics markets more than offset the lower
volumes in the air cargo market which decreased in sales to $22 million from
$26 million and government/military markets which decreased in sales to $16
million from $21 million for the years ended March 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

Marketing

ZERO employs manufacturers' representatives, direct sales people and some
distributors to market its non-consumer products worldwide. Technical support is
provided by engineering personnel from ZERO's various plants. The Company's
standard enclosures products and accessories are sold through catalogs,
advertisements, trade journals and independent distributors. Nonstandard or
specialized enclosure products and accessories are marketed through
manufacturers' representatives and direct sales people. ZERO's consumer oriented
products are marketed worldwide through catalogs, advertisements, telemarketing
programs and trade journals, and are distributed through established independent
dealers.

Competition

While reliable statistics are not available to permit the Company to accurately
estimate its share of the total market for each of its business segments, the
Company believes it has a significant share of the enclosures and accessories
market that it serves. ZERO competes with a number of other larger and smaller
companies. The degree and type of competition that ZERO encounters varies for
both of its business segments.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
The Company believes it effectively competes in both of its business segments by
providing engineering expertise, innovative design, superior quality and on-time
delivery at a competitive price. ZERO's ability to successfully compete in the
Enclosures and Accessories segment is also attributable to its broad range of
standard products. Approximately 2,000 dies, capable of producing over 75,000
standard deep drawn aluminum enclosures, provide ZERO with both a cost and
service advantage in a large portion of its metal case and enclosure business.
In addition, ZERO offers thousands of sizes of fabricated cases and hundreds of
standard configurations for system packaging. The thermal management systems,
which cool or heat a wide range of electronics, includes products such as
blowers, fans, air conditioning systems and electronic controlling systems.
Competitive strength is also derived by the Company's ability to modify standard
products to satisfy a variety of applications and customer requirements.

Sales and Backlog

ZERO's backlog at March 31, 1995 and 1994 was $40,278,000 and $40,302,000,
respectively. Backlog is based on contracts which were signed as of the
respective dates set forth. The backlog at March 31, 1995 is scheduled for
delivery during fiscal 1996.

Certain contracts, particularly those with the United States Government and its
contractors, provide for cancellation for convenience of the customer. If such
cancellation occurs, the contractor is paid for costs incurred to date plus the
costs of settling and paying claims of terminated subcontractors, other
settlement expenses and a reasonable profit on its costs. During the five years
ended March 31, 1995, the aggregate amount of orders cancelled for the
convenience of the United States Government has not been material. However, no
assurance can be given that this pattern will continue in the future.

For the year ended March 31, 1995, approximately 9% of ZERO's sales were made to
the government/military market.

A majority of ZERO's sales orders are in amounts of less than $10,000 each.
These orders generally are delivered 1 to 6 weeks from the time the order is
booked. Larger orders and custom orders may take several weeks to over a year
depending on the delivery schedule set by the customer. Because of the large
number of customers served (in excess of 20,000), the relatively small size of
each order and the relatively short delivery cycles involved, the Company
believes the risk is low of any order being cancelled which would have a
significant adverse effect on operations.

Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used by ZERO in manufacturing its products are
aluminum and steel and, to a lesser extent, plastics. Such materials are
purchased under competitive bids at levels sufficient to meet foreseeable
production and delivery schedules from an adequate source of suppliers. Other
raw materials and supplies necessary for the production of ZERO's products are
purchased from a variety of suppliers. As of June 16, 1995, the Company was not
experiencing shortages in the supply of its raw materials. Based on market and
economic conditions at that date, ZERO believes that the supply and availability
of these materials will be adequate to support its level of operations projected
through March 31, 1996. However, the Company can make no assurances that such
materials will be available beyond that period, and any shortage of such
materials could have a significant and material adverse impact on the operations
of the Company.

Environmental Matters

The information regarding environmental matters relating to operations in prior
years is discussed in Note 7 - "Contingent Liabilities" on page 22 of the 1995
Annual Report addressing environmental matters in which ZERO has been named a
"potentially responsible party" is incorporated herein by reference.

ZERO has developed and implemented an environmental program to reduce or
eliminate the use of hazardous material in its current operations. Through
changes in production processes, capital expenditures, proper training and
the use of state-of-the-art treatment and monitoring equipment, the Company
believes its program is controlling the use and discharge of hazardous materials
and is in substantial compliance with applicable local, state and Federal
regulations. The Company does not expect that any assertions of noncompliance
with such laws relating to its current operations will materially adversely
affect its earnings or competitive position or will require any significant
capital expenditures during fiscal year 1996.

                                       3

Employees

As of May 31, 1995, ZERO employed approximately 1,800 persons. Employee
relations are considered good. Only certain employees at the Company's Samuel
Groves & Co. Limited subsidiary and ZERO Stantron Cabinets division are
represented by unions which are not affiliated with any national union.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

As of June 16, 1995, ZERO used manufacturing plants, facilities and office
buildings containing an aggregate of approximately 1,483,000 square feet of
floor space. ZERO's plants and facilities are located in California (Camarillo,
Chino, City of Industry, El Monte, Pacoima, Rancho Dominguez and San Diego);
Utah (North Salt Lake); Massachusetts (Monson); New Jersey (Princeton Junction
and Windsor); Minnesota (Champlin); Connecticut (Hartford); Tijuana, Mexico; and
Birmingham, Feltham, and West Midlands, England. The plants located in
Camarillo, City of Industry, El Monte, Pacoima and San Diego, California; in
North Salt Lake, Utah; in Princeton Junction and Windsor, New Jersey; and in
Champlin, Minnesota, are used in the production of enclosures and accessories.
The remaining plants are used by both business segments.

ZERO owns all its plants and facilities, except for the following leased
properties:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     For the years ended March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, Net Income was 
$14,825,000, $12,851,000 and $11,635,000 and Earnings Per Share were $.93, $.81
and $.74, respectively.

     Net Sales in fiscal 1995 grew 4.6% over the amount reported in fiscal 1994.
This compares to a sales growth of 7.1% in 1994 when compared to 1993. The
increase in 1995 was primarily attributable to higher sales applicable to the
telecommunications/instrumentation and data processing markets, partially offset
by declines in the air cargo and government/military markets. In fiscal 1994,
growth in the telecommunications/instrumentation, data processing and air cargo
markets as well as the acquisition of a case hardware business in August 1993,
was partially offset by weakness in government/military markets. Interest income
was higher in 1995 due to higher level of investments, higher interest rates and
reduced investments in municipal bonds.

     Cost of sales, as a percentage of Net Sales, was 64.0% in 1995 versus 65.2%
in 1994 and 64.8% in 1993. In 1995, the cost of sales as a percentage of Net
Sales was lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable product mix,
higher volume and cost-containment efforts, partially offset by increased
material and supply costs. In fiscal 1994, cost-containment efforts and stable
material costs were offset by changes in product mix and competitive pricing.

     Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of Net Sales, was
21.2% in 1995, 20.9% in 1994 and 21.6% in 1993. The percentage in 1995 was
higher than 1994 despite higher sales volumes primarily as a result of
expenditures related to environmental matters and a facility reorganization.
Increased sales and cost-containment efforts in 1994 resulted in a lower
percentage than 1993.

     EFFECT OF INFLATION - Price increases by ZERO have not contributed
significantly to increases in the Company's Net Sales. The impact of rising
costs of labor, materials and supplies, and equipment has been mitigated, in
part, by changes in product design, overall manufacturing and purchasing
efficiencies, and effective management and control of operating expenses.

================================================================================
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (cont.)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - At March 31, 1995, the Company's primary
source of liquidity was $37,034,000 of cash and short-term investments. Working
capital increased to $73,531,000 from $66,980,000 at March 31, 1994 as a result
of higher earnings and cash flow.

     Cash provided by operating activities was $18,141,000 in 1995, $14,817,000
in 1994 and $19,299,000 in 1993. Such cash generated from operating activities
during those years was invested primarily in property additions and the purchase
of certain assets of a small business in 1993. The higher property additions in
1995 resulted primarily from the construction of a new manufacturing plant. Cash
utilized in financing activities was primarily for the payment of dividends.

     Management believes cash from operations, together with the Company's 
short-term investments and ability to obtain financing, will provide sufficient
funds to finance current and forecasted operations, including potential
acquisitions. The Company will continue to invest its cash reserves in liquid,
lower-risk investments.

     CONTINGENCIES - The Company has been notified by certain governmental
agencies or third party litigants that it is, or may be, potentially responsible
for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of six sites where
soil and/or groundwater contamination is alleged. The Company is working with
the governmental agencies and other parties to resolve these matters. The
Company has provided reserves to cover those costs which can be reasonably
estimated at this time. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of environmental and other contingencies.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1  Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include mutual funds and other highly liquid
investments purchased with maturities of three months or less. As of March 31,
1995 and 1994, the carrying values of cash equivalents approximated fair market
values.

Short-Term Investments - Short-term investments at March 31, 1995 and 1994
consisted primarily of treasury notes, treasury bills and municipal bonds which
are classified as securities available-for-sale. Market prices which
approximated cost at the balance sheet dates are reasonable estimates of the
portfolio's fair value.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
or average) or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Capital leases and leasehold
improvements are amortized over the life of the related assets or the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter.

Intangible Assets - Costs in excess of the value of net assets acquired in
purchase transactions are being recorded as goodwill and amortized over periods
of up to 40 years. The Company reviews the recoverability of intangible assets
to determine if there has been any permanent impairment. Such review includes
operating performance and cash flows and future prospects of the business. If a
permanent impairment has occurred, a reserve for such impairment would be
recorded.

Earnings per Common Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
(stock options) outstanding, which for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was 16,020,063,
15,958,366 and 15,791,972, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate and gains and
losses are being accumulated in stockholders' equity. The related income
statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (cont.)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concentrations of Credit Risks - Financial instruments that potentially subject
a company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result of the
diverse nature of the Company's customer base. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information - For the years ended March 31, 1995, 1994
and 1993 cash paid for income taxes was $8,333,000, $8,588,000 and $6,152,000,
respectively, and cash paid for interest was not material.

NOTE 2  Property, Plant and Equipment  

     Property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation and amortization
at March 31, 1995 and 1994 consisted of:

NOTE 3  Employee Benefits  

     The Company has a defined contribution pension plan and, as of January 1,
1995, a 401(k) plan which, except for employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement at one plant, cover all employees who have completed at
least one year of service and are employed by U.S. divisions which have elected
to participate. The pension plan cost, which is fully funded on a current basis,
is based upon percentages of eligible employees' compensation. The Company's
contributions to the pension plan aggregated $1,507,000, $1,460,000 and
$1,253,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and aggregated $95,000 to the
401(k) plan in 1995.

     The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans covering key
employees who can elect to have a portion of their compensation deferred. The
amounts set aside earn interest at rates generally higher than the average prime
interest rate. Interest expense accrued on the participants' accounts totalled
$620,000, $463,000 and
<PAGE>
 
================================================================================
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (cont.)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$356,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Generally, payment of a
participant's account balance will be deferred until death, disability or
retirement.

NOTE 4  Common Stock  

     The Company has a stock option plan which provides for the granting to
directors, officers and other key employees of options to purchase shares of the
Company's stock at a price not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant. Options are granted for terms of five to eight years and are exercisable
in annual installments (generally one-third of the total grant) commencing one
year from date of grant, on a cumulative basis.

     The Company's stock option plan provides for the granting of qualified and
nonqualified options as well as stock appreciation rights (SARs) in tandem with
options. The SARs entitle a holder to receive an amount equal to the excess of
the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of exercise over
the option price. The exercise of SARs automatically cancels an equal number of
related options. Compensation expense recognized in connection with SARs during
the years ended March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was not material.

NOTE 5  Income Taxes  

     Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes". The adoption of SFAS 109 changed the Company's method of
accounting for income taxes from the deferred approach (APB 11) to an asset and
liability approach. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of
assets and liabilities. Financial statements for prior years have not been
restated and the cumulative effect of the accounting change was not material.

     The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:

leases at March 31, 1995 were not material.

NOTE 7  Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters  In March 1994, the Company along with twenty-three other
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) entered into a consent decree with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) relating to the remedial design
work necessary for implementing a groundwater extraction and treatment system
for the Glendale North and South Operable Units of the San Fernando Valley
Superfund Site (the Site). The current estimate to complete the remedial design
work is approximately $2,000,000 of which the Company's current estimate of its
share is approximately $180,000.

     In addition, the Company has been named as a third party defendant in
certain lawsuits brought by the EPA and the State of California against certain
parties in the North Hollywood Operable Unit. The Company is vigorously
defending itself in these actions. Also, the Company is engaged in remediation
and/or environmental monitoring at three locations, has been named by the State
of California as potentially responsible at one location, and 
<PAGE>
 
================================================================================
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (cont.)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

was named as a third party defendant at an additional location.

     The Company has provided reserves for its share of the remedial design
costs for the Site to the extent they could be reasonably estimated at this
time. However, the Company's ultimate liability related to environmental matters
at the Site will be dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the
designs and costs of remediation systems, as well as the allocation of those
costs among the participants including any additional PRPs. In addition, the
Company has provided for the cleanup costs associated with five other sites
discussed above to the extent they could be reasonably estimated at this time.

     The Company has commenced litigation against certain of its insurance
carriers for the recovery of expenditures related to the Site but has not
anticipated any insurance recoveries in its estimate.

Other Matters - On January 4, 1994, the Company responded to an administrative
subpoena received from the U.S. Government General Services Administration
(GSA), Office of Inspector General, seeking documents related to certain GSA
contracts of a division of the Company. The Company has heard nothing further
from the GSA since that date and, therefore, is unable to accurately assess the
situation further at this time. The Company believes that the subpoena was
directed to an examination of freight charges under GSA contracts.

     The Company is subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of its business activities. In the opinion of management, any
liability that may result from the resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Stockholders of ZERO Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ZERO
Corporation and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of consolidated income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1995. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ZERO Corporation and its
subsidiaries at March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1995
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by
management in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and,
where appropriate, include amounts based on management's judgement and
estimates. The integrity of the financial statements and the other financial
information in the Annual Report is the responsibility of management. The
financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent
auditors, appointed by the Board of Directors.

     The Company maintains internal accounting control systems that are adequate
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the assets are
safeguarded from loss or unauthorized use. These systems produce records
adequate for preparation of financial information. In establishing and
maintaining internal controls, the Company exercises judgment in determining
that the costs of such controls do not exceed the benefits to be derived.

     The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed solely of directors
who are not officers or employees. The Committee meets regularly with
management, with the Company's internal audit staff, and with the independent
auditors. The independent auditors and the internal audit staff periodically
meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Audit Committee
at any time.

     In management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ZERO Corporation and
its subsidiaries at March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of operations and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1995 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
