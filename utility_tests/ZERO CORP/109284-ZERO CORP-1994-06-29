                                 PART I

Item 1.  Business.

ZERO Corporation (the "Company", ZERO, or "Registrant") was incorporated in
Delaware in 1988 as a successor in interest to a California corporation of the
same name that was originally incorporated in 1952. Its executive offices are
located at 444 South Flower Street, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, CA 90071-2922,
telephone (213) 629-7000.

The Company, through nine U.S. companies and one foreign company, considers
itself a leader in the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of engineered
cases, system packaging, and various products used in the airline/air cargo
industry. ZERO's engineered cases include custom and standard deep drawn
aluminum ZERO boxes; ZERO Halliburton (Register Mark) luggage, attaches and
carrying cases; thermoformed and rotationally molded plastic cases and
enclosures; other standard and custom fabricated cases (marketed under the Anvil
Cases (Register Mark) brand name); and specialized case hardware. The Company's
engineered cases are widely used in commercial, industrial and
government/military applications. The Company's system packaging business
involves engineering, manufacturing and/or integrating standard and custom
electronic enclosures and cabinets, and related components such as card cages,
backplanes, and power supplies; and cooling equipment, including motorized
impellers, blowers, fan trays, heat exchangers and air conditioners. The
Company's airline/air cargo products include specialized aluminum, polycarbonate
and fiberglass air cargo containers; patented telescoping baggage/cargo systems;
air cargo restraint systems and hardware; and transit cases engineered to meet
the Air Transport Association's highest specifications. Over fifty percent of
ZERO's net sales in fiscal 1994 were linked to the electronics industry through
customers doing business in the telecommunication/instrumentation, and data
processing/peripherals markets.

ZERO's operations are classified under two business segments: Enclosures and
Accessories, and Other. Information about ZERO's business segments is set forth
in Note 8 "Segment Information" on page 28 of the 1994 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

During the three years ended March 31, 1994, the Company did not derive a
material portion of its sales or net income from its foreign operations nor has
the Company been dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss
of which would have a material adverse effect on its operations.

Patents, licenses, franchises and concessions are not an important factor in
ZERO's overall production process and are not material to its results of
operation.

Development of new products is not a significant part of the Company's business.
During the year ended March 31, 1994, the Company spent less than 1% of net
sales on research and development activities.

Marketing

In marketing non-consumer oriented products in its two business segments, ZERO
employs manufacturers' representatives, direct salespeople and some distributors
to market its products worldwide. Technical support for these manufacturers'
representatives, salespeople and distributors is provided by engineering
personnel from ZERO's various plants. The Company's standard enclosure products
and accessories are sold through catalogs, advertisements, trade journals and
independent distributors. Nonstandard or specialized enclosure products and
accessories are marketed through manufacturers' representatives and direct
sales. ZERO's consumer oriented products are marketed worldwide through
catalogs, advertisements in selected publications, telemarketing programs, trade
journals and are distributed through established independent dealers who
specialize in the market to which each of ZERO's products is related.
<PAGE>
 
Competition

While reliable statistics are not available that would permit the Company to
accurately estimate its share of the total market for each of its business
segments, the Company believes it has a significant share of the enclosures and
accessories market that it serves. ZERO competes with a number of other
companies, both larger and smaller. The degree and type of competition that ZERO
encounters varies for both of its business segments.

The Company believes it effectively competes in both of its business segments by
providing engineering expertise, innovative design, superior quality and on-time
delivery at a competitive price. ZERO's ability to successfully compete in the
Enclosures and Accessories segment is also attributable to its broad range of
standard products. Approximately 2,000 dies, capable of producing over 75,000
standard deep drawn aluminum enclosures, provides ZERO with both a cost and
service advantage in a large portion of its metal case and enclosure business.
In addition, ZERO offers thousands of sizes of fabricated cases and hundreds of
standard configurations for system packaging. Competitive strength is also
derived by the Company's ability to modify standard products to satisfy a
virtually limitless number of applications and customer requirements.

Sales and Backlog

ZERO's backlog at March 31, 1994 and 1993 was $40,302,000 and $39,415,000,
respectively. Backlog is based on contracts which were signed as of the
respective dates set forth. Approximately 93% of the backlog at March 31, 1994
is scheduled for delivery during fiscal 1995.

Certain contracts, particularly those with the United States Government and its
contractors, provide for cancellation for convenience of the customer. If such
cancellation occurs, the contractor is paid for costs incurred to date plus the
costs of settling and paying claims of terminated subcontractors, other
settlement expenses and a reasonable profit on its costs. During the five years
ended March 31, 1994, the aggregate amount of orders cancelled for the
convenience of the United States Government has not been material. However, no
assurance can be given that this pattern will continue in the future.

For the year ended March 31, 1994, approximately 12% of Zero's sales were made
to the government/military market.

A majority of ZERO's sales orders are in amounts of less than $10,000 each.
These orders generally are delivered 1 to 6 weeks from the time the order is
booked. Larger orders and custom orders may take several weeks to over a year
depending on the delivery schedule set by the customer. Because of the large
number of customers served (in excess of 19,000), the relatively small size of
each order and the relatively short delivery cycles involved, the Company
believes the risk of any order being cancelled which would have a significant
adverse effect on operations is low.

<PAGE>
 
Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used by ZERO in manufacturing its products are
aluminum and steel and, to a lesser extent, plastics. Such materials are
purchased under competitive bids at levels sufficient to meet foreseeable
production and delivery schedules. For the year ended March 31, 1994, ZERO
purchased aluminum and steel from over ten principal suppliers. Plastics and
other raw materials and supplies necessary for the production of ZERO's products
are purchased from a variety of suppliers. As of June 17, 1994, the Company was
not experiencing shortages in the supply of its raw materials. Based on market
and economic conditions at that date, ZERO believes that the supply and
availability of these materials will be adequate to support its level of
operations projected through March 31, 1995. However, the Company can make no
assurances that such materials will be available beyond that period, and any
shortage of such materials could have a significant and material adverse impact
on the operations of the Company.

Environmental Matters

ZERO has developed and implemented an environmental program to reduce or
eliminate the use of hazardous material and possible contamination. Through
changes in production processes, capital expenditures, proper training and the
use of state-of-the-art treatment and monitoring equipment, the Company believes
its program is controlling the use and discharge of hazardous materials and is
in substantial compliance with applicable local, state and Federal regulations.
The Company does not expect that any assertions of noncompliance with such laws
will materially adversely affect its earnings or competitive position or will
require any significant capital expenditures during fiscal year 1995.

Information in Note 7 - "Contingent Liabilities" on page 27 of the 1994 Annual
Report addressing environmental matters in which ZERO has been named a
"potentially responsible party" is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees

As of May 31, 1994, ZERO employed 1,684 persons. Employee relations are
considered good. Certain employees at the Company's Samuel Groves & Co. Limited
subsidiary and ZERO Stantron Cabinets division are represented by unions which
are not affiliated with any national unions. In the past ten years the Company
has not experienced a significant work stoppage from a labor dispute.

Item 2.  Properties.

As of June 17, 1994, ZERO used manufacturing plants and office buildings
containing an aggregate of approximately 1,389,000 square feet of floor space.
ZERO's plants are located in California (Camarillo, City of Industry, El Monte,
Pacoima, Rancho Dominguez and San Diego); Utah (North Salt Lake); Massachusetts
(Monson); New Jersey (Princeton Junction); Minnesota (Brooklyn Park);
Connecticut (Hartford); Tijuana, Mexico; and Birmingham and Feltham, England.
The plants located in Camarillo, City of Industry, El Monte, Pacoima and San
Diego, California; in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota; in Princeton Junction, New
Jersey; and in North Salt Lake, Utah, are used in the production of enclosures
and accessories. The remaining plants are used by both business segments.

* Lease contains renewal option.

ZERO's plants and facilities used in operations are generally constructed of
concrete block, brick, concrete tilt-up, steel or a combination thereof. ZERO's
facilities and equipment are well maintained and are believed to be adequate to
support a substantial increase in its operations, assuming a comparable product
mix.

        INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
        ----------------------------

        To the Stockholders of ZERO Corporation:

        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of ZERO
        Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 1994
        and 1993, and for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
        1994, and have issued our report thereon dated May 12, 1994; such
        financial statements and report are included in your 1994 Annual Report
        to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference. Our audits
        also included the financial statement schedules of the Company, listed
        in Item 14(a)(2). These financial statement schedules are the
        responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
        express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such financial
        statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial
        statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
        information set forth therein.

     SECTION 2. Principal Office.  The principal office for the transaction of

of the Corporation (the "Board") may determine.  The Board is hereby granted
full power and authority to change said principal office from one location to
another.

     SECTION 3. Other Offices.  The Corporation may also have an office or
offices at such other place or places, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Board may from time to time determine or as the business of the
Corporation may require.

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS


     SECTION 1.  Place of Meetings.  All annual meetings of stockholders and all
other meetings of stockholders shall be held either at the principal office or
at any other place within or without the State of Delaware which may be
designated by the Board pursuant to authority hereinafter granted to the Board.

     SECTION 2.  Annual Meetings.  Annual meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of
such other proper business as may come before such meetings may be held at such
time, date and place as the Board shall determine by resolution.

Corporation for any purpose or purposes may only be called in accordance with
the provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation.

                                  Exhibit 3.2
<PAGE>
 
     SECTION 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Except as otherwise required by law,
notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be
given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting by
delivering a typewritten or printed notice thereof to such stockholder
personally, or by depositing such notice in the United States mail, in a postage
prepaid envelope, directed to such stockholder at such stockholder's post office
address furnished by such stockholder to the Secretary of the Corporation for
such purpose, or, if such stockholder shall not have furnished an address to the
Secretary for such purpose, then at such stockholder's post office address last
known to the Secretary, or by transmitting a notice thereof to such stockholder
at such address by telegraph, cable or wireless.  Except as otherwise expressly
required by law, no publication of any notice of a meeting of the stockholders
shall be required.  Every notice of a meeting of stockholders shall state the
place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting,
shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called.  Notice of any
meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder to
whom notice may be omitted pursuant to applicable Delaware law or who shall have
waived such notice, and such notice shall be deemed waived by any
stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy, except a
stockholder who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting,
at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Except as otherwise expressly
required by law, notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders need not be
given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken.

     SECTION 5. Quorum.  Except as otherwise required by law, the holders of
record of a majority in voting interest of the shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to be voted thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation or any adjournment thereof.  Subject to the
requirement of a larger percentage vote contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or by statute, the stockholders present at a duly
called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business
until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
In the absence of a quorum at any meeting or any adjournment thereof, a majority
in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote thereat or, in the absence therefrom of all the stockholders,
any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting may
adjourn such meeting from time to time.  At any such adjourned meeting at which
a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally called.

     SECTION 6.  Voting.

     A. Each stockholder shall, at each meeting of stockholders, be entitled to
vote in person or by proxy each share of the stock of the Corporation having
voting rights on the matter in question and which shall have been held by such
stockholder and registered in such stockholder's name on the books of the
Corporation:

          (i) on the date fixed pursuant to Article VI, Section 5 of these
     Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
     notice of and to vote at such meeting, or

          (ii) if no such record date shall have been so fixed, then (a) at the
     close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of the
     meeting shall be given or (b) if notice of the meeting shall be waived, at
     the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
     meeting shall be held.

     B. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors in such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes.  Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity
shall be entitled to vote such stock.  Persons whose stock is pledged shall be
entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the
Corporation the pledgor shall have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote
thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or the pledgee's proxy, may represent
such stock and vote thereon.  Stock having voting power standing of record in
the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership,
joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or with
respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall
be voted in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

     C. Any such voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled
thereto in person or by such stockholder's proxy appointed by an instrument in
writing, subscribed by such stockholder or by such stockholder's attorney
thereunto authorized and delivered to the secretary of the meeting; provided,
however, that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date unless said proxy shall provide for a longer period.  The attendance at any
meeting of a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy shall not have
the elect of revoking the same unless such stockholder shall in writing so
notify the secretary of the meeting prior to the voting of the proxy.  At any
meeting of stockholders, all matters, except as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, in these Bylaws or by law, shall be decided by the
vote of a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or
by proxy and entitled to vote thereat and thereon, a quorum being present.  The
vote at any meeting of stockholders on

any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the
meeting.  On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder
voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall
state the number of shares voted.

     SECTION 7. List of Stockholders. The Secretary of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of such stockholder.  Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to
the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

     SECTION 8. Judges. If at any meeting of stockholders a vote by written
ballot shall be taken on any question, the chairman of such meeting may appoint
a judge or judges to act with respect to such vote. Each judge so appointed
shall first subscribe an oath faithfully to execute the duties of a judge at
such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of such judge's
ability.  Such judges shall decide upon the qualification of the voters and
shall report the number of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to
vote on such question, shall conduct and accept the votes, and, when the voting
is completed, shall ascertain and report the number of shares voted respectively
for and against the question.  Reports of judges shall be in writing and
subscribed and delivered by them to the Secretary of the Corporation. The judges
need not be stockholders of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation
may be a judge on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in
which such officer shall have a material interest.

any of its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of
Delaware as the Board or such committee may from time to time by resolution

participate in any regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment
pursuant to which all persons participating in the meeting of the Board or such

or purposes shall be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or, if the
Chairman of the Board is absent or unable or refuses to act, by the President.

records and is not readily ascertainable, at the place in which the meetings of
the directors are regularly held.  In case such notice is mailed, telegraphed,
telexed, facsimiled, or sent by overnight courier it shall be deposited in the
United States mail, delivered to the telegraph company in the County in which
the principal office for the transaction of the business of the Corporation is
located or deposited with an overnight courier service at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to the time of the holding of the meeting.  In case such notice is
delivered personally as above provided, it shall be delivered at least twenty-
four (24) hours prior to the time of the holding of the meeting.  Such mailing,
telegraphing, telexing, facsimiling or overnight delivery as above provided
shall be due, legal and personal notice to such director.  Except where
otherwise required by law or by these Bylaws, notice of the purpose of a special
meeting need not be given.  Notice of any meeting of the Board shall not be
required to be given to any director who is present at such meeting, except a
director who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at
the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

     SECTION 10. Quorum and Manner of Acting.  Except as otherwise provided in
these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or by  applicable law, the
presence of a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be required
to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the
Board, and all matters shall be decided at any such meeting, a quorum being
present, by the affirmative votes of a majority of the directors present.  A
meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business
notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, provided any action taken is
approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting.  In the
absence of a quorum, a majority of directors present at any meeting may adjourn
the same from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any
adjourned meeting need not be given.  The directors shall act only as a Board,
and the individual directors shall have no power as such.

     SECTION 11.  Action by Consent.  Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken

the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

services as directors in an amount fixed by resolution of the Board, and, in
addition, a fixed fee, with or without expenses of attendance, may be allowed by
resolution of the Board for attendance at each meeting, including each meeting
of a committee of the Board. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an
officer, agent, employee, or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.

     SECTION 13.  Committees.  The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority
of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist
of one or more of the directors of the Corporation.  Any such committee, to the
extent provided in the resolution of the Board and subject to any restrictions
or limitations on the delegation of power and authority imposed by applicable
Delaware law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may
authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may
require it.  Any such committee shall keep written minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the Board at the next regular meeting of the Board.  Unless
the Board or these Bylaws shall otherwise prescribe the manner of proceedings of
any such committee, meetings of any such committee may be regularly scheduled in
advance and may be called at any time by the chairman of the committee or by any
two members thereof; otherwise, the provisions of these Bylaws with respect to
notice and conduct of meetings of the Board shall govern.

                           SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER


     SECTION 1. Certificates for Stock. Every owner of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate or certificates, to be in such form as
the Board shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of the
stock of the Corporation owned by such owner.  The certificates representing
shares of such stock shall be numbered in the order in which they shall be
issued and shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the
Board, the President or any Vice President, and by the Secretary or the
Treasurer.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificates may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon, any such certificate, shall have
ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as though the person who signed such certificate, or whose
facsimile signature shall have been placed thereupon, were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.  A record shall be kept of the
respective names of the persons, firms or corporations owning the stock
represented by such certificates, the number and class of shares represented by
such certificates, respectively, and the respective dates thereof, and in case
of cancellation, the respective dates of cancellation.  Every certificate
surrendered to the Corporation for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and
no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing
certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except
in cases provided for in Section 4 of this Article VI.

     SECTION 2. Transfers of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the

holder thereof, or by such holder's attorney thereunto authorized by power of
attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary, or with a transfer clerk or
a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 3 of this Article VI, and upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed
and the payment of all taxes thereon.  The person in whose name shares of stock
stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all
purposes as regards the Corporation.  Whenever any transfer of shares shall be
made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact shall be so
expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates
shall be presented to the Corporation for transfer, both the transferor and the
transferee request the Corporation to do so.

     SECTION 3. Regulations.  The Board may make such rules and regulations as
it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these Bylaws, concerning the issue,
transfer and registration of certificates for shares of the stock of the
Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any officer or officers to appoint,
one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one or more
registrars, and may require all certificates for stock to bear the signature or
signatures of any of them.

     SECTION 4. Lost, Stolen, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates.  In any case
of loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any certificate of stock, another
may be issued in its place upon proof of such loss, theft, destruction, or
mutilation and upon the giving of a bond of indemnity to the Corporation in such
form and in such sum as the Board may direct; provided, however, that a new
certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of
the Board, it is proper so to do.

     SECTION 5. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.

     A. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and
which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days
before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed by the Board, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of such meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record
date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.  If no record
date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the

also be credited earnings on a quarterly basis equal to the Moody's Seasoned
Corporate Bond Rate for the last month of each quarter on which earnings are
applied plus three percent (3%) until such account value is distributed pursuant
to Article VI hereof. Plan Compensation deferred shall be deemed to be invested
and accruing earnings starting on the date the amounts deferred are credited to
the Bookkeeping Account.

     5.03  The Participant shall at all times have a nonforfeitable right to the
value of his or her Bookkeeping Account attributable to his or her own deferrals
under paragraph 4.01 of Article IV hereof plus interest credited thereon, with
no right of offset by the Company.

                                 DISTRIBUTIONS
                                 -------------

     6.01  At the time of electing deferrals for each Plan Year, a Participant
shall specify the amount to be deferred, and any other matter required to be
specified by the Company on its Election Form.  In addition, in his or her
initial deferral election, Participant shall specify the payment method and
commencement date (relative to the date of Separation from Service) which shall
apply to all amounts deferred in the initial year and in all subsequent years.
A separate designation of payment commencement time and method of distribution
shall be made depending upon whether a Participant's Separation from Service
occurs on or after attaining age 60 or before attaining age 60.  The period of
deferral shall end, and distribution of the value of a Participant's Bookkeeping
Account shall begin on the date specified in the Participant's initial deferral
election.  The Participant may elect to receive distributions in substantially
equal installments over a five (5) or ten (10) year period or in a lump sum, or
in such other payment form as offered by the Company.  In the case of any
payment deferred beyond Separation from Service, interest at the rate specified
in paragraph 5.02 of Article V shall be credited on all amounts remaining in the
Bookkeeping Account of the Participant from which the payments are to be made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, after the initial deferral
election, modify any election with respect to either time of payment
commencement or the method of distribution without penalty so long as such
change is made at least one (1) year before the commencement date previously
elected; provided, however, the Named Fiduciary must make a determination that
such subsequent modification in election would not have a detrimental effect on
the tax consequences of benefits deferred hereunder or such subsequent
modification will be disregarded.

     6.02  In the event of a Participant's death before the payments have
commenced hereunder, the Participant's Bookkeeping Account shall be distributed
as soon as practicable after his or her death to his or her Beneficiary(ies)
designated in accordance with Article VIII hereof in the manner selected on the
Participant's initial Election Form. In the event of a Participant's death after
payments have commenced, any remaining amounts in the Participant's Bookkeeping
Account shall be distributed to the Participant's Beneficiary(ies) in the same
manner of distribution as was being followed at the time of his or her death.

     6.03  Notwithstanding paragraphs 6.01 and 6.02 hereof, if the total amount
in a Participant's Bookkeeping Account is Fifty Thousand ($50,000) Dollars or
less, such Bookkeeping Account shall be distributed to him or her in full within
thirty (30) days after  Separation from Service or upon the occurrence of a
Disability or shall be distributed in full to his or her Beneficiary upon his or
her death.  In the event that either the Named Fiduciary or the Committee
determines, in their sole discretion, that a Change in Control is likely, the
Company will, effective automatically and concurrently with the Change in
Control, deposit in one or more grantor trusts (within the meaning of Section
671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) funds in an amount sufficient to pay
Participant that amount which is the value of his or her Bookkeeping Account.

     6.04  All distributions of a Participant's Bookkeeping Account hereunder
shall be made in cash payments only and shall commence not later than January 1
of the first year following the Director's Separation from Service.

     6.05  The Company shall have the right to deduct from all payments any
federal, state, local or foreign taxes or other charges required by law to be
withheld or elected by the Participant to be withheld with respect to such
payments.

     6.06  Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, a
Participant may take a distribution of all or a portion of his or her
Bookkeeping Account in a manner inconsistent with his or her deferral election
even though the Participant is not then suffering a financial hardship, as
defined in paragraph 7.01 of Article VII hereof, provided that the distribution
is reduced by ten percent (10%), to be adjusted upward or downward as required
by law.  The ten percent (10%) reduction shall be forfeited to the
Company.

                             ----------------------

     7.01  At the request of a Participant before complete distribution
of his or her Bookkeeping Account, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
accelerate and pay all or part of the value of a Participant's Bookkeeping
Account due under the Plan.  Accelerated distributions at the request of the
Participant or a Participant's Beneficiary may be allowed only in the event of a
financial emergency beyond the Participant's or Beneficiary's control due to
unforeseeable circumstances and only if disallowance of a distribution would
create a severe hardship for the Participant or Beneficiary. An accelerated
distribution must be limited to only that amount necessary to relieve the
financial emergency.

designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the Plan payable
in the event of his or her death before complete distribution of his or her
Bookkeeping Account.  If more than one Beneficiary is named, the share and/or
precedence of each Beneficiary shall be indicated.  A Participant shall have the
right to change the Beneficiary by notifying the Named Fiduciary in the
appropriate spaces of a revised Beneficiary Designation Form.  However, no
designation or change in designation of Beneficiary shall be effective until
received, accepted and acknowledged by the Company.

     8.02  The Committee shall be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary
Designation Form filed by the Participant and accepted by the Committee prior to
his or her death.  If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary
to receive payments hereunder, the Committee shall have the right to direct the
Company to withhold such payments until the matter is finally adjudicated.
However, any payment made by the Company, in good faith and in accordance with
the Plan and the directions of the Committee, shall fully discharge the Company
and the Committee from all further obligations with respect to that payment.

     8.03  In making any payments to or for the benefit of any minor or
incompetent Beneficiary, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
direct the Company to make a distribution to a legal or natural guardian or
other relative of a minor or court appointed committee of such incompetent.
Alternatively, the Committee may direct the Company to make a payment to any
adult with whom the minor or incompetent temporarily or permanently resides.
The receipt by a guardian, committee, relative or other

person shall be a complete discharge to the Company and the Committee. Neither
the Committee nor the Company shall have any responsibility to see to the proper
application of any payments so made.

                          ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
                          --------------------------

     9.01  The Plan shall be administered by the Employee Benefits Committee as
constituted and approved from time to time by the Board.  Such persons shall
serve at the pleasure of the Board.  Participants in this Plan may serve as
members of the Committee. All resolutions or other actions taken by the
Committee shall be by vote of a majority of those present at a meeting at which
a majority of the members are present, or in writing by a majority of all the
members at the time in office if they act without a meeting.

     9.02  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall, from time to
time, establish rules, forms and procedures for the administration of the Plan.
Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the Committee shall have the
exclusive right to interpret the Plan and to make, amend, interpret and enforce
all rules adopted in connection with the Plan and to decide any and all matters
arising hereunder or in connection with the administration of the Plan, and it
shall endeavor to act, whether by general rules or by particular decisions, so
as not to discriminate in favor of or against any person. The decisions, actions
and records of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company
and all persons having or claiming to have any right or interest in or under the
Plan.

     9.03  In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to
time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it deems
appropriate and may, from time to time, consult with counsel who may be counsel
to the Company.

     9.04  The members of the Committee and the officers and Directors of the
Company shall be entitled to rely on all certificates and reports made by any
duly appointed accountants, and on all opinions given by any duly appointed
legal counsel, which legal counsel may be counsel for the Company.

     9.05  To enable the Committee to perform its functions, the Company shall
supply full and timely information to the Committee on all matters relating to
the compensation of Participants and the date and circumstances of the
Separation from Service or death or Disability of a Participant and such other
pertinent information as the Committee may reasonably require.

                                 Exhibit 10.3
<PAGE>
 
     9.06  The Company shall indemnify and save harmless each member of the
Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her
membership on the Committee. Expenses against which a member of the Committee
shall be indemnified hereunder shall include, without limitation, the amount of
any settlement or judgment, costs, counsel fees, and related charges reasonably
incurred in connection with a claim asserted, or a proceeding brought or
settlement thereof. The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition
to any other rights to which any such member of the Committee may be entitled as
a matter of law.

                               CLAIMS PROCEDURE
                               ----------------

     10.01  Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this
instrument. The Participant, or a Beneficiary or any other person claiming
through the Participant, shall make a written request for benefits under this
Plan. This written claim shall be mailed or delivered to the Named Fiduciary who
shall review such claim.

     10.02  If the claim is denied, in full or in part, the Named Fiduciary
shall provide a written notice within forty-five (45) days setting forth the
specific reasons for denial, and any additional material or information
necessary to perfect the claim, and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary, and appropriate information and explanation of the
steps to be taken if a review of the denial is desired.

     10.03  If the claim is denied and a review by the full Committee is
desired, the Participant (or Beneficiary) shall notify the Named Fiduciary in
writing within thirty (30) days (a claim shall be deemed denied if the Named
Fiduciary does not take any action within the aforesaid forty-five (45) day
period) after receipt of the written notice of denial. In requesting a review,
the Participant or his or her Beneficiary may request a review of the Plan
document or other pertinent documents, may submit any written issues and
comments, and may request that a hearing be held, but the decision to hold a
hearing shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee.

     10.04  The decision on the review of the denied claim shall be rendered by
the Committee within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the request for
review (if a hearing is not held) or within sixty (60) days after the hearing if
one is held. The decision shall be written and shall state the specific reasons
for the decision including reference to specific provisions of the Plan on which
the decision is based.

<PAGE>
 
     10.05  If, after the review process, a claimant seeks further redress,
the subject of the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in Los Angeles,
California, in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect, which arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy of
the parties hereto.  The resulting arbitration award shall be deemed a final
order of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and shall not be
appealable.  All fees and expenses connected with the arbitration proceeding,
other than counsel fees incurred by either party, if any, shall be shared
equally by both parties.

                                  ARTICLE XI
                           AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
                           -------------------------

     11.01  The Company, by action of the Board, may amend or modify this
Plan from time to time or may terminate the Plan if it deems appropriate;
provided that no such amendment, modification or termination shall in any
way reduce the vested portion of affected Participants' (or Beneficiaries')
Bookkeeping Accounts measured as of the date the amendment, modification or
termination is made, or, if later, the effective date of such actions; and,
provided further, no amendment or modification which would reduce the interest
rate below Moody's as set forth in paragraph 5.02 of Article V hereof, or which
would assess costs or fees to Participants, may be made without the unanimous
consent of all Participants in the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                                 MISCELLANEOUS
                                 -------------
                                        
     12.01  The Company's obligation under the Plan shall in every case be
an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay. Participants' rights as to benefits
hereunder shall be no greater than that of general, unsecured creditors of the
Company.  The Company may establish one or more grantor trusts as described in
Section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, although the Company shall not
be obligated under any circumstances to fund its financial obligations under the
Plan.  Any assets which the Company may acquire or set aside to help cover its
financial liabilities are and must remain general assets of the Company and such
assets as well as any assets set aside in any grantor trust shall be subject to
the claims of its general creditors.  Neither the Company nor the Plan gives the
Participant any beneficial ownership interest in any asset of the Company.  All
rights of ownership in any such assets are and remain in the Company.

     12.02  Except insofar as permitted by applicable law, no sale, transfer,
alienation, assignment, pledge, collateralization or attachment of any benefits
under the Plan shall be valid or recognized by the Company. Neither the
Participant, his or her

                                      11

                                 Exhibit 10.3
<PAGE>
 
spouse, or designated Beneficiary shall have any power to hypothecate, mortgage,
commute, modify or otherwise encumber in advance of any of the benefits payable
hereunder, nor shall any of said benefits be subject to seizure for the payment
of any debts, judgments, alimony maintenance, owed by the Participant or his
Beneficiary, or be transferable by operation of law in the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, if the
Committee so determines in its sole discretion, follow the terms of any court
order issued in connection with any domestic relations proceeding including but
not limited to marital dissolution or child support.

     12.03  The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its assigns, and any
successor company which shall succeed to substantially all of its assets and
business through merger, acquisition or consolidation, and upon a Director, his
or her Beneficiary, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators.

     12.04  The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to
constitute a contract of employment between the Company and a Director.  Nothing
in this Plan shall of itself be deemed to give a Director the right to be
retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with any right of the
Company to discipline or discharge the Director at any time.

     12.05  A Director will cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all
information reasonably requested by the Company and take such other actions as
may be requested in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and the
payment of benefits hereunder.

     12.06  In case any provisions of this Plan shall be found illegal or
invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal and invalid provision had never been included herein.

     12.07  Any notice which shall be or may be given under the Plan or an
Election Form shall be in writing and shall be mailed by United States mail,
postage prepaid.  If notice is to be given to the Company, such notice shall be
addressed to the Company at 444 South Flower Street, Suite 2100, Los Angeles,
California 90071-2922, marked for the attention of the Corporate Secretary of
the Company or, if notice to a Director, addressed to the address shown on such
Director's Election Form or the last known address on the Company's personnel
records.  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a
Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and sent by
facsimile, hand delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the
Participant.  Any party may, from time to time, change the address to which
notices shall be mailed by giving written notice of such new address.

                                       12

                                 Exhibit 10.3
<PAGE>
 
     12.08  The interest in the benefits hereunder of a spouse of a Participant
who has predeceased the Participant shall automatically pass to the Participant
and shall not be transferable by such spouse in any manner, including but not
limited to such spouse's will, nor shall such interest pass under the laws of
intestate succession.

     12.09  If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participant's benefit
under this Plan becomes taxable to the Participant prior to receipt, a
Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of funds sufficient to
meet the Participant's tax liability (including additions to tax, penalties and
interest). Upon the grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the Company shall distribute to the Participant
immediately available funds in an amount equal to that Participant's federal,
state and local tax liability associated with such taxation, which liability
shall be measured by using that Participant's then current highest federal,
state and local marginal tax rate, plus the rates or amounts for the applicable
additions to tax, penalties and interest. This distribution shall include an
additional amount to "gross up" the tax liability distribution to include all
applicable taxes on the tax liability distribution and the grossed up amount. If
the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution (including gross-up)
shall be made within ninety (90) days of the date when the Participant's
petition is granted. Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the benefits to
be paid under Articles VI or VII hereof.

     12.10  The benefits provided for a Participant and Participant's
Beneficiary under the Plan are in addition to any other benefits available to
such Participant under any other plan or program for employees of the Company.
The Plan shall supplement and shall not supersede, modify or amend any other
such plan or program except as may otherwise be expressly provided.

     12.11  The payment of benefits under the Plan to a Participant or
Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge the Company and the Committee
from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to a Participant, and
that Participant's Election Form shall terminate upon such full payment of
benefits.

     12.12  Without limiting the provisions of paragraph 9.06 of Article IX
above, if any action at law or in equity is necessary by a Participant or
Beneficiary to enforce the terms of the Plan, the Participant or Beneficiary
shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and necessary
disbursements in addition to any other relief to which that party may be
entitled.

     12.13  Titles and headings of the Articles of the Plan are included for
ease of reference only and are not to be used for the purpose of construing
any portion or provision of the Plan document.

     12.14  To the extent not preempted by Federal law, this Plan shall be
governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of California.

     12.15  Any Election Form may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which is legally binding and enforceable.

     3.01  Only Executives may participate in the Plan.  As a condition to
becoming a Participant hereunder, however, an Executive must complete and return

portion of his or her Plan Compensation during a Plan Year following the
applicable Election Date deferred and credited to the Participant's Bookkeeping
Account in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The amount of such
Plan Compensation to be so deferred under this paragraph 4.01 for a Plan Year
shall be any whole number or percentage as the Participant shall select
on his or her Election Form; provided, that such amount for any Plan Year shall
not be less than Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars.

     4.02  An Executive desiring to participate in the Plan must submit his or
her written Election Form to the Named Fiduciary before the applicable Election
Date. Valid Election Forms filed by the applicable Election Date shall cause
Plan Compensation to be deferred for the Plan Year (or portion thereof in the
case of Participants for whom paragraph 2.08(b) of Article II is the applicable
Election Date) for which such Election is made.

     4.03  A Participant who has not submitted to or does not have on file a
valid Election Form with the Named Fiduciary before the applicable Election Date
may not defer any Plan Compensation for the applicable Plan Year.

                        ------------------------------

     5.01  Plan Compensation deferred by a Participant under a written Election
Form shall be credited in a dollar amount to a separate Bookkeeping Account for
each Participant as of the date on which such Plan Compensation would otherwise
be payable to the Participant.


     5.02  The deferrals credited to the Participant's Bookkeeping Account shall
also be credited earnings on a quarterly basis equal to the Moody's Seasoned
Corporate Bond Rate for the last month of

each quarter on which earnings are applied plus three percent (3%) until such
account value is distributed pursuant to Article VI hereof. Plan Compensation
deferred shall be deemed to be invested and accruing earnings starting on the
date the amounts deferred are credited to the Bookkeeping Account.

     5.03  The Participant shall at all times have a nonforfeitable right to the
value of his or her Bookkeeping Account attributable to his or her own deferrals
under paragraph 4.01 of Article IV hereof plus interest credited thereon, with
no right of offset by the Company.


                                  ARTICLE VI
                                 DISTRIBUTIONS
                                 -------------

     6.01  At the time of electing deferrals for each Plan Year, a Participant
shall specify the amount to be deferred, and any other matter required to be
specified by the Company on its Election Form.  In addition, in his or her
initial deferral election, Participant shall specify the payment method and
commencement date (relative to the date of Separation from Service) which shall
apply to all amounts deferred in the initial year and in all subsequent years.
A separate designation of payment commencement time and method of distribution
shall be made depending upon whether a Participant's Separation from Service
occurs on or after attaining age 60 or before attaining age 60.  The period of
deferral shall end, and distribution of the value of a Participant's Bookkeeping
Account shall begin on the date specified in the Participant's initial deferral
election.  The Participant may elect to receive distributions in substantially
equal installments over a five (5) or ten (10) year period or in a lump sum, or
in such other payment form as offered by the Company.  In the case of any
payment deferred beyond Separation from Service, interest at the rate specified
in paragraph 5.02 of Article V shall be credited on all amounts remaining in the
Bookkeeping Account of the Participant from which the payments are to be made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may, after the initial deferral
election, modify any election with respect to either time of payment
commencement or the method of distribution without penalty so long as such
change is made at least one (1) year before the payment commencement date
previously elected; provided, however, the Named Fiduciary must make a
determination that such subsequent modification in election would not have a
detrimental effect on the tax consequences of benefits deferred hereunder or
such subsequent modification will be disregarded.


     6.02  In the event of a Participant's death before the payments have
commenced hereunder, the Participant's Bookkeeping Account shall be distributed
as soon as practicable after his or her death to his or her Beneficiary(ies)
designated in accordance with Article VIII hereof in the manner selected on the
Participant's Election Form.  In the event of a 

                                       6

                                 Exhibit 10.4
<PAGE>
 
Participant's death after payments have commenced, any remaining amounts in the
Participant's Bookkeeping Account shall be distributed to the Participant's
Beneficiary(ies) in the same manner of distribution as was being followed at the
time of his or her death.

     6.03  Notwithstanding paragraphs 6.01 and 6.02 hereof, if the total amount
in a Participant's Bookkeeping Account is Fifty Thousand ($50,000) Dollars or
less, such Bookkeeping Account shall be distributed to him or her in full within
thirty (30) days after  Separation from Service or upon the occurrence of a
Disability or shall be distributed in full to his or her Beneficiary upon his or
her death.  In the event that either the Named Fiduciary or the Committee
determines, in their full discretion, that a Change in Control is likely, the
Company will, effective automatically and concurrently with the Change in
Control, deposit in one or more grantor trusts (within the meaning of Section
671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) funds in an amount sufficient to pay
Participant that amount which is the value of his or her Bookkeeping Account.

     6.04  All distributions of a Participant's Bookkeeping Account hereunder
shall be made in cash payments only and shall commence not later than January 1
of the first year following the Executive's attainment of age 65; provided,
                                                                  -------- 
however, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Participant who as of January 1,
- - -------                                                                     
1994 had more than twenty (20) years of service with the Company must commence
distribution not later than the January 1 following the year in which he or she
attains age 65 or has a Separation from Service, whichever is later.

     6.05  The Company shall have the right to deduct from all payments any
federal, state, local or foreign taxes or other charges required by law to be
withheld or elected by the Participant to be withheld with respect to such
payments.

     6.06  Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, a
Participant may take a distribution of all or a portion of his or her
Bookkeeping Account in a manner inconsistent with his or her deferral election
even though the Participant is not then suffering a financial hardship, as
defined in paragraph 7.01 of Article VII hereof, provided that the distribution
is reduced by ten percent (10%), to be adjusted upward or downward as required
by law.  The ten percent (10%) reduction shall be forfeited to the
Company.

                             ----------------------

     7.01 At the request of a Participant before complete distribution of his or
her Bookkeeping Account, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate
and pay all or part of the value of a Participant's Bookkeeping Account due
under the Plan. Accelerated distributions at the request of the Participant or a
Participant's Beneficiary may be allowed only in the event of a financial
emergency beyond the Participant's or Beneficiary's

                                       7

control due to unforeseeable circumstances and only if disallowance of a
distribution would create a severe hardship for the Participant or Beneficiary.
An accelerated distribution must be limited to only that amount necessary to
relieve the financial emergency.

                                  BENEFICIARY
                                  -----------

     8.01  A Participant shall, by completing the Beneficiary Designation
Form, designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the Plan
payable in the event of his or her death before complete distribution of his or
her Bookkeeping Account.  If more than one Beneficiary is named, the share
and/or precedence of each Beneficiary shall be indicated.  A Participant shall
have the right to change the Beneficiary by notifying the Named Fiduciary in the
appropriate spaces of a revised Beneficiary Designation Form.  However, no
designation or change in designation of Beneficiary shall be effective until
received, accepted and acknowledged by the Company.

     8.02  The Committee shall be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary
Designation Form filed by the Participant and accepted by the Committee prior to
his or her death.  If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary
to receive payments hereunder, the Committee shall have the right to direct the
Company to withhold such payments until the matter is finally adjudicated.
However, any payment made by the Company, in good faith and in accordance with
the Plan and the directions of the Committee, shall fully discharge the Company
and the Committee from all further obligations with respect to that payment.

     8.03  In making any payments to or for the benefit of any minor or
incompetent Beneficiary, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
direct the Company to make a distribution to a legal or natural guardian or
other relative of a minor or court appointed committee of such incompetent.
Alternatively, the Committee may direct the Company to make a payment to any
adult with whom the minor or incompetent temporarily or permanently resides.
The receipt by a guardian, committee, relative or other person shall be a
complete discharge to the Company and the Committee. Neither the Committee nor
the Company shall have any responsibility to see to the proper application of
any payments so made.

                           ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
                           --------------------------

     9.01  The Plan shall be administered by the Employee Benefits
Committee as constituted and approved from time to time by the Board.  Such
persons shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.  Participants in this Plan may
serve as members of the Committee.

                                 Exhibit 10.4
<PAGE>
 
All resolutions or other actions taken by the Committee shall be by vote of a
majority of those present at a meeting at which a majority of the members are
present, or in writing by a majority of all the members at the time in office if
they act without a meeting.

     9.02  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall, from time
to time, establish rules, forms and procedures for the administration of the
Plan.  Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the Committee shall have
the exclusive right to interpret the Plan and to make, amend, interpret and
enforce all rules adopted in connection with the Plan and to decide any and all
matters arising hereunder or in connection with the administration of the Plan,
and it shall endeavor to act, whether by general rules or by particular 
decisions, so as not to discriminate in favor of or against any person. The
decisions, actions and records of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Company and all persons having or claiming to have any right or
interest in or under the Plan.

     9.03  In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time
to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it
deems appropriate and may, from time to time, consult with counsel who may be
counsel to the Company.

     9.04  The members of the Committee and the officers and directors of
the Company shall be entitled to rely on all certificates and reports made by
any duly appointed accountants, and on all opinions given by any duly appointed
legal counsel, which legal counsel may be counsel for the Company.

     9.05  To enable the Committee to perform its functions, the Company
shall supply full and timely information to the Committee on all matters
relating to the compensation of Participants and the date and circumstances of
the Separation from Service or death or Disability of a Participant and such
other pertinent information as the Committee may reasonably require.

     9.06  The Company shall indemnify and save harmless each member of the
Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her
membership on the Committee. Expenses against which a member of the Committee
shall be indemnified hereunder shall include, without limitation, the amount of
any settlement or judgment, costs, counsel fees, and related charges reasonably
incurred in connection with a claim asserted, or a proceeding brought or
settlement thereof.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition
to any other rights to which any such member of the Committee may be entitled as
a matter of law.

                                ----------------

     10.01  Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
this instrument.  The Participant, or a Beneficiary or any other person claiming
through the Participant, shall make a written request for benefits under this
Plan.  This written claim shall be mailed or delivered to the Named Fiduciary
who shall review such claim.

     10.02  If the claim is denied, in full or in part, the Named Fiduciary
shall provide a written notice within forty-five (45) days setting forth the
specific reasons for denial, and any additional material or information
necessary to perfect the claim, and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary, and appropriate information and explanation of the
steps to be taken if a review of the denial is desired.

     10.03  If the claim is denied and a review by the full Committee is
desired, the Participant (or Beneficiary) shall notify the Named Fiduciary in
writing within thirty (30) days (a claim shall be deemed denied if the Named
Fiduciary does not take any action within the aforesaid forty-five (45) day
period) after receipt of the written notice of denial.  In requesting a review,
the Participant or his or her Beneficiary may request a review of the Plan
document or other pertinent documents, may submit any written issues and
comments, and may request that a hearing be held, but the decision to hold a
hearing shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee.

     10.04  The decision on the review of the denied claim shall be
rendered by the Committee within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the
request for review (if a hearing is not held) or within sixty (60) days after
the hearing if one is held.  The decision shall be written and shall state the
specific reasons for the decision including reference to specific provisions of
the Plan on which the decision is based.

     10.05  If, after the review process, a claimant seeks further redress,
the subject of the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in Los Angeles,
California, in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect, which arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy of
the parties hereto.  The resulting arbitration award shall be deemed a final
order of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and shall not be
appealable.  All fees and expenses connected with the arbitration proceeding,
other than counsel fees incurred by either party, if any, shall be shared
equally by both parties.

                           -------------------------

     11.01  The Company, by action of the Board, may amend or modify this
Plan from time to time or may terminate the Plan if it deems appropriate;
provided that no such amendment, modification or termination shall in any
way reduce the vested portion of affected Participants' (or Beneficiaries')
Bookkeeping Accounts measured as of the date the amendment, modification or
termination is made, or, if later, the effective date of such actions; and,
provided further, no amendment or modification which would reduce the interest
rate below Moody's as set forth in paragraph 5.02 of Article V hereof, or which
would assess costs or fees to Participants, may be made without the unanimous
consent of all Participants in the Plan.

     12.01  The Company's obligation under the Plan shall in every case be
an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay. Participants' rights as to benefits
hereunder shall be no greater than that of general, unsecured creditors of the
Company.  The Company may establish one or more grantor trusts as described in
Section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, although the Company shall not
be obligated under any circumstances to fund its financial obligations under the
Plan.  Any assets which the Company may acquire or set aside to cover its
financial liabilities are and must remain general assets of the Company and such
assets as well as any assets set aside in any grantor trust shall be subject to
the claims of its general creditors.  Neither the Company nor the Plan gives the
Participant any beneficial ownership interest in any asset of the Company.  All
rights of ownership in any such assets are and remain in the Company.

     12.02 Except insofar as permitted by applicable law, no sale, transfer,
alienation, assignment, pledge, collateralization or attachment of any benefits
under the Plan shall be valid or recognized by the Company. Neither the
Participant, his or her spouse, or designated Beneficiary shall have any power
to hypothecate, mortgage, commute, modify or otherwise encumber in advance of
any of the benefits payable hereunder, nor shall any of said benefits be subject
to seizure for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony maintenance, owed by
the Participant or his Beneficiary, or be transferable by operation of law in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may, if the Committee so determines in its sole
discretion, follow the terms of any court order issued in connection with any
domestic relations proceeding including but not limited to marital dissolution
or child support.

     12.03  The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its assigns, and
any successor company which shall succeed to substantially all of its assets and
business through merger, acquisition or consolidation, and upon an Executive,
his or her Beneficiary, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators.

     12.04  The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to
constitute a contract of employment between the Company and an Executive.
Nothing in this Plan shall of itself be deemed to give an Executive the right to
be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with any right of the
Company to discipline or discharge the Executive at any time.

     12.05  An Executive will cooperate with the Company by furnishing any
and all information reasonably requested by the Company and take such other
actions as may be requested in order to facilitate the administration of the
Plan and the payment of benefits hereunder.

     12.06  In case any provisions of this Plan shall be found illegal or
invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal and invalid provision had never been included herein.

     12.07  Any notice which shall be or may be given under the Plan or an
Election Form shall be in writing and shall be mailed by United States mail,
postage prepaid.  If notice is to be given to the Company, such notice shall be
addressed to the Company at 444 South Flower Street, Suite 2100, Los Angeles,
California 90071-2922, marked for the attention of the Corporate Secretary of
the Company or, if notice to an Executive, addressed to the address shown on
such Executive's Election Form or the last known address on the Company's
personnel records.  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a
Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and sent by
facsimile, hand delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the
Participant.  Any party may, from time to time, change the address to which
notices shall be mailed by giving written notice of such new address.

     12.08  The interest in the benefits hereunder of a spouse of a
Participant who has predeceased the Participant shall automatically pass to the
Participant and shall not be transferable by such spouse in any manner, 
including but not limited to such spouse's will, nor shall such interest pass
under the laws of intestate succession.

     12.09  If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participant's
benefit under this Plan becomes taxable to the Participant prior to receipt, a
Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of funds sufficient to
meet the Participant's tax liability (including additions to tax, penalties 

                                      12

and interest). Upon the grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the Company shall distribute to the Participant
immediately available funds in an amount equal to that Participant's federal,
state and local tax liability associated with such taxation, which liability
shall be measured by using that Participant's then current highest federal,
state and local marginal tax rate, plus the rates or amounts for the applicable
additions to tax, penalties and interest. This distribution shall include an
additional amount to "gross up" the tax liability distribution to include all
applicable taxes on the tax liability distribution and the grossed up amount. If
the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution (including gross-up)
shall be made within ninety (90) days of the date when the Participant's
petition is granted. Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the benefits to
be paid under Articles VI or VII hereof.

     12.10  The benefits provided for a Participant and Participant's
Beneficiary under the Plan are in addition to any other benefits available to
such Participant under any other plan or program for employees of the Company.
The Plan shall supplement and shall not supersede, modify or amend any other
such plan or program except as may otherwise be expressly provided.

     12.11  The payment of benefits under the Plan to a Participant or
Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge the Company and the Committee
from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to a Participant, and
that Participant's Election Form shall terminate upon such full payment of
benefits.

     12.12  Without limiting the provisions of Section 9.06 above, if any
action at law or in equity is necessary by a Participant or Beneficiary to
enforce the terms of the Plan, the Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled
to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and necessary disbursements in
addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.

     12.13  Titles and headings of the Articles of the Plan are included
for ease of reference only and are not to be used for the purpose of construing
any portion or provision of the Plan document.

     12.14  To the extent not preempted by Federal law, this Plan shall be
governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of California.

     12.15  Any Election Form may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which is legally binding and enforceable.

                                ZERO CORPORATION

                             MANAGEMENT BONUS PLAN



                                   I. Purpose

     The purpose of the ZERO Corporation Management Bonus Plan is to encourage
management of ZERO Corporation ("ZERO") to strongly perform for the benefit of
ZERO stockholders and to fairly compensate management for performance.

                            II.  Target Performance

     Each management employee who is a participant in the ZERO Management Bonus
Plan at the beginning of each fiscal year, will be assigned a "Target Bonus" by
the President of ZERO which shall be a percentage of the participant's salary.
The Target Bonus of the President shall be assigned by the Compensation
Committee and approved by the Board Directors.

                   III.  Factors to Determine Award of Bonus

     The award of Bonus shall be determined by three factors measured during a
fiscal year of ZERO:

     a.  Net Income - Actual Net Income for the plan fiscal year calculated as a
percentage of the Plan I forecast as presented by management to the Board of
Directors and approved by the Board of Directors at its April meeting, in each
case calculated pre-bonus (the "% of Plan I").

     b.  Stockholder Value - The percentage increase in stockholder value during
the plan fiscal year measured by the Common Stock price of ZERO on the New York
Stock Exchange on the last day of January, February and March of the preceding
fiscal year and the plan fiscal year, plus cash dividends paid during the fiscal
year, and adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends (the "Increase in
Stockholder Value").

     c. Tangible Stockholders' Equity - The percentage increase in tangible
Stockholders' Equity during the plan fiscal year measured by Stockholders'
Equity, less goodwill, reflected on the books of ZERO on the last day of the
preceding fiscal year and on the last day of the plan fiscal year (the "Increase
in Stockholders' Equity").  For purposes of these calculations, the public
issuance or repurchase of Common Stock (except normal purchases or sales
pursuant to ZERO's employee stock purchase or stock option plans as approved by
stockholders) and goodwill resulting from an acquisition shall be excluded only
from the first year that they are reflected on the financial statements.

                                 Exhibit 10.5
<PAGE>
 
                   IV.  Weight of Factors to Determine Bonus

     In connection with the award of a Bonus, the factors set forth in III above
shall have the following weights:

                a. % of Plan I                      = 60 points
                b. Increase in Stockholder Value    = 15 points
                c. Increase in Stockholders' Equity = 25 points

If, after calculation of the factors, 100 points are earned, then 100% of the
Target Bonus will be paid.  (Likewise, if 75 points are earned, 75% of the
Target Bonus will be paid; if 125 points are earned, 125% of the Target Bonus
will be paid.)

                               V.  Calculations

          a.  % of Plan I - An award of 60 points will be made if 95% of Plan I
is achieved.  For each 1 percentage point achieved above or below 95% of Plan I,
there will be added or subtracted 5 points.  No points will be awarded unless at
least 55% of Plan I is achieved.

          b.  Stockholder Value - An award of 15 points will be made if an
increase of 7.5% of Stockholder Value is achieved.  For each 1 percentage point
achieved above or below 7.5%, there will be added or subtracted 2.5 points.  In
no event will the number of points awarded be less than zero.

          c.  Stockholders' Equity - An award of 25 points will be made if an
increase of 5% in Stockholders' Equity is achieved.  For each 1 percentage point
achieved above or below 5%, there will be added or subtracted 5 points.  In no
event will the number of points awarded be less than zero.

                          VI.  Unusual Circumstances

          In the event of unusual circumstances during the plan fiscal year,
such as extraordinary income or expense or dramatic market downturns, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall reserve to itself the
power to modify the factors described above to achieve fairness, which
modification shall be subject to approval of the Board of Directors.

                        DESCRIPTION OF ZERO CORPORATION
                    SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
                           ADOPTED JANUARY 19, 1994

The purpose of the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan adopted January 19, 
1994 (the "Plan") is to restore benefits to certain executive employees of the 
Corporation under the ZERO Corporation Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") where 
benefits are lost to such executive employees as a result of the enactment by 
the Internal Revenue Service of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(the "Code").

The Plan is administered and interpreted by the Employee Benefits Committee of 
the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which Committee establishes rules, 
forms and procedures for the administration of the Plan, has the exclusive right
to interpret the Plan and to make, amend, and enforce all provisions of the 
Plan.

Eligible employees include executive employees of the Company, its divisions and
subsidiaries.

Each participant under the Plan is entitled to contribution from the Company in
an amount equal to the reduction in the contributions to the account of the 
participant under the Pension Plan as a result of contribution limitations 
established by Sections 415 and/or 401(a)(17) of the Code. Company contributions
are made on the date which is the earlier of the date of separation of 
employment from the Company or on December 31 of each year.

              CONTRACT AND JOINT SUPPLEMENTAL LIFE INSURANCE PLAN
                            ADOPTED APRIL 22, 1994

The Company and certain of its executive officers and other key employees of the
Company, its divisions and subsidiaries, have entered into Contracts under the
Joint Supplemental Life Insurance Plan (the "Plan") under which the executive
receives an insurance benefit and the cash value of the life insurance policy on
the life of the executive. The Company pays a portion of the premium and the
executive also pays a portion of the premium equal to the economic benefit of
the insurance the executive receives as established by the Internal Revenue
Service. The executive owns the policy under the Plan but must repay any amounts
advanced by the Company. The obligation of the executive is secured by a
collateral assignment of the cash value and death proceeds under the policy of
insurance.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
  Condition includes the Five-Year Consolidated Financial Highlights on the
  inside front cover and the following additional information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the years ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, Net Income was $12,851,000,
  $11,635,000 and $9,695,000 and Earnings Per Share were $.81, $.74 and $.62,
  respectively.

Net Sales in fiscal 1994 grew 7.1% over the amount reported in fiscal 1993. This
  compares to a minor sales growth in 1993 when compared to 1992. The increase
  in 1994 was primarily attributable to higher sales applicable to the
  communication/instrumentation, data processing/peripherals and the airline/air
  cargo markets, as well as the acquisition of a case hardware business in
  August 1993. In fiscal 1993, similar growth in the communication/
  instrumentation and data processing/peripherals markets was offset by weakness
  in the airline/air cargo, consumer and government/military markets.

Cost of sales, as a percentage of Net Sales, was 65.2% in 1994 versus 64.8% in 
  1993 and 66.5% in 1992. Over the past several years, the Company has
  benefited from cost-containment efforts, including the relocation and
  restructuring of several facilities, and stable material costs, partially
  offset by changes in product mix and pricing strategies.

Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of Net Sales, decreased to 
  20.9% in 1994 from 21.6% in 1993 and 22.1% in 1992 primarily as a result of
  net sales fluctuations and cost-containment efforts.


EFFECT OF INFLATION - Price increases have not contributed significantly to
  increases in the Company's Net Sales. The impact of rising costs of labor,
  material and supplies, and equipment has been mitigated by changes in product
  design, overall manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies and effective
  management and control of operating expenses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - At March 31, 1994, the Company's primary
  source of liquidity was $33,368,000 of cash and short-term investments.
  Working capital increased to $66,980,000 from $59,576,000 at March 31, 1993 as
  a result of higher earnings and operating efficiencies. During 1994, the
  Company repaid the remaining portion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Cash provided by operating activities was $14,817,000 in 1994, $19,299,000 in
  1993 and $17,311,000 in 1992, while property additions during those years were
  $4,160,000, $5,236,000 and $7,176,000, respectively. The higher property
  additions during 1992 were the result of plant relocations.

Management believes cash from operations, together with the Company's short-term
  investments and ability to obtain financing, will provide sufficient funds to
  finance current and forecasted operations, including potential acquisitions.
  The Company will continue to invest its cash reserves in liquid, lower-risk
  investments.
 
CONTINGENCIES - The Company has been notified by governmental agencies that it
  may be potentially responsible for costs associated with the investigation and
  remediation of eight sites where soil and/or groundwater contamination is
  alleged. The Company has responded to these notices and is working with the
  governmental agencies and other parties involved to resolve these matters. The
  Company has provided reserves to cover those costs which can be reasonably
  estimated. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
  further discussion of environmental and other contingencies.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 Significant Accounting Policies:

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
  include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
  intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include mutual funds and other highly liquid
  investments purchased with maturities of three months or less. As of March 31,
  1994 and 1993, the carrying values of cash equivalents approximated fair
  market values.

Short-Term Investments - Short-term investments at March 31, 1994 and 1993
  consisted primarily of treasury notes and municipal bonds. Municipal bonds are
  carried at the lower of aggregate cost (computed on a first-in, first-out
  basis) or market. Based on quoted market prices, the aggregate fair value of
  short-term investments as of March 31, 1994 and 1993 was $18,550,000 and
  $20,944,000, respectively.

Inventories - Substantially all of the Company's inventories are stated at the
  lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market.
  
Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
  cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over
  the estimated useful lives of the assets. Capital leases and leasehold
  improvements are amortized over the life of the related assets or the life of
  the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill - Costs in excess of the value of net assets acquired in purchase
  transactions are being amortized over periods of up to 40 years.
 
Earnings per Common Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the
  weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
  (stock options) outstanding, which for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was 15,958,366,
  15,791,972 and 15,733,093, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
  are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate. Gains and
  losses from this translation are being accumulated in stockholders' equity.
  The related income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for
  the year.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information - For the years ended March 31, 1994, 1993
  and 1992 cash paid for interest was $20,000, $157,000 and $299,000 and cash
  paid for income taxes was $8,588,000, $6,152,000 and $5,809,000, respectively.

NOTE 2 Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation at March 31, 1994
  and 1993 consisted of:

NOTE 3 Employee Benefits:

The Company has a defined contribution pension plan which, except for employees
  covered by collective bargaining agreements, covers all employees of U.S.
  divisions which have elected to participate and who have completed at least
  one year of service. The pension plan cost, which is fully funded on a current
  basis, is based upon percentages of eligible employees' compensation. The
  Company's contributions to the plan aggregated $1,460,000, $1,253,000 and
  $1,331,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans covering key employees
  who can elect to have a portion of their compensation deferred. The amounts
  set aside earn interest at rates generally higher than the average prime
  interest rate compounded semi-annually. Interest expense accrued on the
  participants' accounts totalled $463,000, $356,000 and $437,000 in 1994, 1993
  and 1992, respectively. Generally, payment of a participant's account balance
  will be deferred until death, disability or retirement.

NOTE 4 Common Stock :

The Company has a nonqualified and incentive stock option plan which provides
  for the granting to directors, officers and other key employees of options to
  purchase shares of the Company's stock at a price not less than the fair
  market value on the date of grant. Options are granted for terms of five years
  and are exercisable in annual installments (generally one-third of the total
  grant) commencing one year from date of grant, on a cumulative basis.
 
The Company's stock option plan also provides for the granting of stock
  appreciation rights (SARs) in tandem with options. The SARs entitle a holder
  to receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
  Company's common stock on the date of exercise over the option price. The
  exercise of SARs automatically cancels an equal number of related options.
  Compensation expense recognized in connection with SARs during the years ended
  March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was not material.

</TABLE> 

Of the total outstanding options at March 31, 1994 and 1993, options for 320,750
  and 330,029 shares, respectively, were exercisable; and options for 223,751,
  154,233 and 73,266 shares will become exercisable during the fiscal years
  ending March 31, 1995 through 1997, respectively. At March 31, 1994, options
  for 38,329 shares remained available for future grants.

NOTE 5 Income Taxes:

Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
  Income Taxes." The adoption of SFAS 109 changed the Company's method of
  accounting for income taxes from the deferred approach (APB 11) to an asset
  and liability approach. The asset and liability approach requires the
  recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
  consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis
  and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Financial statements for prior years
  have not been restated and the cumulative effect of the accounting change was
  not material.

The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:

Rental expense under operating leases was $2,141,000, $2,390,000 and $2,525,000
  for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Obligations under capital leases at
  March 31, 1994 were not material.

NOTE 7  Contingent Liabilities:

Environmental Matters -
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) by
  various Federal and State authorities for cleanup at eight sites, the most
  significant being in Burbank, California referred to as the Glendale North
  Operable Unit of the San Fernando Valley Superfund Site (the Site). In March
  1994, the Company, along with twenty-three other PRPs, entered into a consent
  decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency relating to the remedial
  design work necessary for implementing a groundwater extraction and treatment
  system for the Site. The current estimate for such remedial design work is
  approximately $3.6 million of which the Company's current share is
  approximately $330,000. The Company has provided reserves for its share of the
  remedial design costs for the Site and other cleanup costs associated with the
  other sites to the extent they could be reasonably estimated. However, the
  Company's ultimate liability related to these environmental matters mentioned
  above will be dependent upon a variety of factors including changes in the
  designs and costs of remediation systems, and the addition or elimination of
  participating PRPs, and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
  The Company has also filed claims and commenced litigation against certain of
  its insurance carriers for recovery of expenditures.

Other  Matters -
The Company has responded to an administrative subpoena received from the U.S.
  Government General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Inspector General,
  seeking documents related to certain GSA contracts of a division of the
  Company. The matter is in a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to
  accurately assess the situation further at this time; however, the Company
  believes that the subpoena was directed to an examination of freight charges
  under the contracts.

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
  course of its business activities. In the opinion of management, any liability
  that may result from the resolution of these matters will not have a material
  adverse effect on its financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Stockholders of ZERO Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ZERO Corporation
and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements
of consolidated income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1994. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
and opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of ZERO Corporation and its
subsidiaries at March 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1994
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by
management in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and,
where appropriate, include amounts based on management's judgement and
estimates. The integrity of the financial statements and the other financial
information in the Annual Report is the responsibility of management. The
financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, independent
auditors, appointed by the Board of Directors.

The Company maintains internal accounting control systems that are adequate to
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the assets are safeguarded
from loss or unauthorized use. These systems produce records adequate for
preparation of financial information. In establishing and maintaining internal
controls, the Company exercises judgement in determining that the costs of such
controls do not exceed the benefits to be derived.

The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed solely of directors who
are not officers or employees. The Committee meets regularly with management,
with the Company's internal audit staff, and with the independent auditors. The
independent auditors and the internal audit staff periodically meet alone with
the Audit Committee and have free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

In management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of ZERO Corporation and its
subsidiaries at March 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of operations and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
